Apple 23"" LCD Cinema Display - This huge 23"" computer monitor is perfect for the prosumer and professional alike. Imagine multi-tasking with multiple full-size windows open simultaneously, or editing video with a super-wide timeline! It has a native resolution of 1920x1200, and a contrast ratio 400:1, for stunning quality on either a Mac or a PC. Brightness - 400 cd/m2 Viewing Angle - 170 degrees horizontal / 170 degrees vertical Antiglare Hardcoat Screen Treatment Kensington Security Port User Controls - Display Power, System Sleep, System Wake, Brightness and Display Tilt Connects to a PC or Macintosh via a digital DVI connectionFrom the ManufacturerFeast your eyes on 1,920 x 1,200 pixels in the 23-inch Apple Cinema Display. The Apple Cinema Display line features a gorgeous new anodized aluminum enclosure to complement the Power Mac G5 or PowerBook G4.Eliminate Tunnel VisionThe widescreen design of the Apple Cinema Display line offers a natural format for arranging documents the way your brain processes them - longer wide than high. That's why each display gives you the best view for your work. It just makes sense to be able to display a Web page and its code next to each other horizontally, or long video timelines in wide format. Apple engineers find that the nearly 100-pixel per inch resolution is ideal for images, yet allows you to easily work with sophisticated type treatments or just plain email. This painstaking attention to detail moves the industry forward and gives you best LCD technology available.Enjoy One or Two Artful DisplaysThe Apple Cinema display matches the sculpted aluminum enclosures of the Power Mac G5 and PowerBook. This strong, anodized aluminum also allows for an exceptionally narrow bezel, so you can use multiple displays together seamlessly. The Cinema Display hovers above your desk on a curvaceous stand, and hardly requires any pressure to adjust the viewing angle from -5 to 25 degrees, since the enclosure is the lightest Apple display ever, at each size. And some ineffable quality of pure elemental aluminum just feels better to the touch.Connect with Pure Digital DVIGive your PowerBook G4 a second display when you're not on the road. Connect directly to any PowerBook G4 with a DVI port. The DVI connection removes all barriers to using an Apple display with a PC, if your graphics card supports DVI with DDC technology for widescreen viewing.Effortless AdjustmentThe smooth motion hinge on your Apple display requires very little pressure to tilt the monitor to a different position. This design allows you to you view the display at whatever angle works for your environment, anywhere from -5 to 25 degrees.Pure SignalWhen you need to manipulate color in any media, image distortion is simply not an option. Analog conversion problems caused by a VGA connection become progressively worse as you move to monitors that have higher resolutions or longer monitor cables. These issues fade away with an all digital signal. DVI transmits a distortion-free digital signal from a digital location in the graphics card to a digital location on the display's screen. This digital connection gives you the full clarity and stability of liquid crystal technology - with sharp, clear pixels from edge to edge.Responsive FeedbackPixel response time provides a good measure of a display's performance in media critical applications, such as video, 3D and motion graphics, or even when you're taking a break with a game. An Apple display provides fast pixel response time across the entire spectrum from black and white, to every shade of gray.Peripheral Devices on Your DesktopThis display includes a FireWire 400 hub and a USB 2.0 hub, each with two ports. So you can connect a printer or scanner, or a digital camera or camcorder. The FireWire port provides a convenient place to plug in an iSight camera for video chat, presented beautifully on your Apple display, or to connect your iPod dock. You can also make best use of all the latest USB 2.0 devices, whether you're using your display with a Mac or PC."

This I received a few days ago, wrote a review about it. Here is a link to the the exact product, full specs, pricing $300, reviews and details:http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824116782Brand new in opened box.  Full warranty. I didn't open any of the cables, etc. This monitor ALSO easily swivels 90 degrees to put it in portrait mode. Here is Tom's review: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/viewsonic-xg2401-24-inch-freesync-monitor,4504-8.htmlTL;DR: This is the best gaming monitor I have ever seen, hands down. And I'm a monitor guy with my triple monitor setup costing over $4K alone.  My impression are 144hz is amazing,  Even in windows everything is smoother and like this hyper realism, more like you're moving your mouse across a sharp photo than a monitor. FreeSync is amazing tech as well.  You NEED an AMD graphics card chipset to enable to feature. Anyways, anyone looking at this monitor has already done their research.  I don't need to sell you on it. Brand new tech, black stabilization is sweet as well.  -Available for pickup at my house (dishonest sellers insist meeting only in parking lots) any normal time near where Bangerter and Redwood Road cross in Riverton/Buffdale.  Or can can meet somewhere nearby if that makes you feel more comfortable. I do travel around sometimes, maybe we can save on travel time. -I accept only Cash (No change given) or Google Wallet or Paypal (you pay fees). Throw me a text or call and I will reply with certain sale status."

Stop wasting money on ink cartridges that just dry up and frustrate you.MSRP priced at $509, the HP Color LaserJet 2550L is a real bargain. The HP Color LaserJet 2550L's output is impressive. Given that you can always add a networking module and optional paper trays after purchase, the 2550L is an excellent choice for a small business that does volume color printing and has big plans for future growth. The boxy HP Color LaserJet 2550L looks like your average workgroup laser printer, with a curvy, two-tone gray casing; a 125-sheet paper-output tray on top; and the usual cluster of buttons and indicator lights on the top control panel. For a color laser, however, it's very lightweight, weighing only 48 pounds, and compact, measuring 18.9 inches wide by 17.8 inches deep by 12.8 inches high. The top control panel buttons include Power, Cancel Print Job, and one that rotates the toner carousel, along with indicator lights that show, among other things, which cartridge is on top or which is low on toner.For more information please contact Doug at 801-259-7017.

39253278,BRAND NEW Micro USB ETHERNET ADAPTER for your Windows Tablet!, Laptop Hardware and Accessories ,"Now you have a brand new tablet running Windows, and you realize it does not come with an Ethernet port like the laptops used to. How are going to connect with your home network? They do come with WI-FI, and in some ways that is convenient. No cables and it is all portable, especially when going out and during travel, right?But what about security? What about speed? When those things matter, nothing beats a solid ground wire, the CAT5e cable you know so well.Personally, I would not recommend doing your sensitive stuff over your WIFI network, on your tablet, like banking, and credit card business, etc. Unless you use this Ethernet adapter. It's microUSB (micro-USB), so it fit's in that tiny port.After the drivers are installed, it's all easy. Turn off WIFI, connect your adapter, do you important matters. Done. Safe.You also get reliable consistent speed. Wi-Fi sometimes is weak, and very slow.The item for sale is a new USB 2.0, 10/100 LAN Ethernet Adapter with a micro USB port. Compatible with Windows 8.1.Text for a quick reply.If you are reading this ad, the item is still available for sale.Thanks."

It has a green line running horizontally across the screen, apparently that kind is fixable. But I don\'t want to deal with it.

The specs are as follows:
1GB ram
1.4Ghz processing
16GB internal memory as well as 16GB SD card that it comes with.

The reason I am selling it is because it is not fast enough to run the program\'s I use. It runs super fast when on the Internet and when using simple programs such as word. I bought it with the intent of using it for school.

It is a touchscreen, but I find it faulty at times and have refrained from using it. The touchpad works great though.

It is a European model only. I bought it while I was on a trip for the equivalent of $200. The reason I\'m selling it for so cheap is because you need a converter to charge it. I can throw one in for $10 if you want it."

Selling some surplus equipment from a location that I closed.Rack mounted.  In perfect working order.  No trades.  Cash only.24 10/100/1000Mbps RJ45 portsFrom the Manufacturer:Go Green With Your EthernetYou now have the choice to go green when upgrading to a gigabit network! This new product TL-SG1024 features the latest innovative energy-efficient technologies that can greatly expand your network capacity with much less power. It automatically adjusts power consumption according to the link status and cable length to limit the carbon footprint of your network.Power down Idle Ports When a computer or network equipment is off, the corresponding port of a traditional switch will continue to consume considerable amounts of power. The TL-SG1024 can automatically detect the link status of each port and reduce the power consumption of ports that are idle.Power Budget According to Cable Length Ideally, shorter cables would use less power because of less power degradation over their length; this is not the case with most devices as they will use the same amount of power across the cable regardless of whether it is 10 or 50 meters(32.8 or 164.0 feet) in length.Superior PerformanceThe TL-SG1024 features non-blocking wire-speed architecture with a 96Gbps switching capacity for maximum data throughput. An 8K MAC address table provides scalability for even the largest networks. It also supports 802.3x Flow Control for full-duplex mode, and back pressure flow control for half-duplex mode alleviates traffic congestion and ensures reliable data transmission.Ease of UseThe auto features of this gigabit switch make installation plug and play and hassle-free. No configuring is required. Auto MDI/MDI-X crossover on all ports eliminate the need for crossover cables or uplink ports.

39133167,100% BRAND NEW Hex-Core i7 5820K + Dual GTX 980 SLI Monster PC, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell high quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.Every single component in this system is BRAND NEW, and I put the rig together specifically with the intention to sell, so it's in absolutely pristine condition - it has only been 'used' for the OS and driver / software installation and subsequent benchmarking and stability testing. Nevertheless, I'm selling it for less than it would cost you to buy the exact same parts yourself, and I've already done all the work of putting it together. When I list 100% brand new machines of this caliber, they generally sell very quickly.This machine is an unstoppable monster loaded with top-shelf gear, including a hex-core i7 CPU and a pair of EVGA GTX 980 graphics cards, plus a full terabyte of solid state storage. Let's be clear: This rig is not for someone who wants to dink around with casual gaming at 1080p. This beast is for someone who wants to destroy cutting edge titles at high resolution and also wants to be able to handle video editing and productivity software with ease.Here are the full specs:Intel Haswell Extreme i7 5820k CPUCorsair Hydro H100i Extreme Liquid CoolerGigabyte GA-X99-SLI MotherboardTwo EVGA GTX 980 ACX2.0 Graphics Cards in SLICorsair Vengeance LPX 32GB (4x8GB) DDR4 2400MHz RAMSamsung 850 Evo 250GB SSDSamsung 840 Evo 750GB Secondary SSDWestern Digital Blue 4TB Tertiary HDDEVGA Supernova 1000P Platinum Rated Modular Power SupplyThermaltake Level 10 GT ChassisMSI Interceptor / Steelseries Kinzu V3 Gaming MouseWindows 10 Professional 64 BitIntel's i7 5820k CPU is a hex-core / 12-thread beast hailing from the 'Extreme' line that ranks higher than anything in the normal consumer stack - including the new Skylake chips, which top out at 4 cores / 8 threads. This chip can crank out an absolute ton of processing horsepower, which is great if you're into CAD or video editing, or even if you just like having the shiniest toys and want to future-proof as much as possible. Now that DirectX12 is a reality, those extra CPU cores are going to be a lot more important than they have been for gaming in the past.You also have the option of overclocking this monster (if you can possibly find a scenario where you actually need more power) and the Corsair H100i liquid cooling system does an incredible job of keeping it cool even under extreme load, so there's plenty of thermal headroom to play with. The LED logo on the H100i can also be customized using Corsair's Link software, so you can match it up to the case lighting colors if you want.The pair of EVGA GTX 980 graphics cards in SLI are also obscenely powerful and form the beating heart of this monster's crazy gaming performance. The ACX2.0 coolers on these cards are awesome and easily keep the temps in the 70s under prolonged stress testing without even cranking the fans that hard. That means you've got overclocking headroom here as well, but even at stock settings they push out a bonkers amount of FPS. Needless to say, these cards are wasted at 1080p and really would be much better suited to a 1440p or 4k monitor. An Oculus Rift would also be a good candidate for taking advantage of the insane performance of these cards.32GB of Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4 2400MHz RAM is a frankly silly amount of memory, considering most games are more than fine on just 8GB. This also gives you more than enough to work with for CAD, video editing, virtual machines, and whatever other productivity software you want to throw at it. Good luck ever actually making use of all that memory, but in the extremely unlikely event you decide that you want more, the motherboard still has 4 slots open and can support a whopping 128GB in total.For permanent storage, the 250GB Samsung 850 EVO SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE and legal license). If you've never had a PC with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back.Want more solid state storage to act as a scratch drive for video editing, or to store your entire library of games without long load times? Never fear, there's also a wicked fast 750GB Samsung 840 Evo SSD installed. What about your massive collection of bluray quality cat videos and roughly 60000 hours of elevator music? There's ALSO a Western Digital Blue mechanical HDD with a whopping 4TB of secondary storage, and if you (somehow) manage to fill all that up there are still plenty of drive bays and SATA ports to spare, so you can very easily add more drives later. There's also an M2 slot in case you want to move to an NVME SSD somewhere down the road.There's no DVD / optical drive installed since I've found most people don't use them any more, BUT if you want one I can include a brand new external USB DVD drive that will get the job done for an extra $10 or so.EVGA's Supernova 220-PS-1000-V1 modular power supply is an absolutely top notch unit that is actually built by Seasonic, the best PSU makers in the business. At 1000 watts this beast provides a crazy amount of juice, probably close to double what this highly efficient murderbox actually draws under load - you've got extra power for days. It's both modular for reduced cable clutter and also platinum rated for efficiency, and it gets a superb 9.6 rating from JonnyGuru (THE goto power supply review site). This is a really fantastic unit:http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&op=Story&reid=421Finally we have the Thermaltake Level 10 GT chassis that all this goodness is packed into. Let me start by showing you a list of just some of the awards this case has won: http://www.thermaltakeusa.com/products-model_review.aspx?id=C_00001675Quite simply, this case is awesome. Of course it has all the features of a flagship: removable dust filters and easy access removable hotswap drive bays, tons of cable management space and routing, integrated fan controller, etc, and it's loaded up with tons of fans for excellent airflow too. It also gives you the option to choose between red, blue, and green lighting, or the ability to cycle between all three or simply no lighting, per your preference. I also love love LOVE the side panel for how easy it is to swing open for access to the interior, and can just as easily be removed entirely. The 200mm intake fan in the side panel has its power delivery built into the door, which is a huge improvement over having to wrangle a loose-hanging power cable. It ALSO has a dust filter on the side intake, which is something you almost never see even on top tier cases, and it pops out for easy cleaning with the push of a button. I have to say that the carrying handle on top is a lifesaver as well, and although the aesthetic isn't for everyone (Thermaltake hired BMW to do the design), I personally think it looks great. At the very least, it's certainly unique!I will also throw in either an MSI Interceptor gaming mouse, or a Steelseries Kinzu V3 MSI edition, per your preference.So there you have it. This machine is a total monster that can destroy any kind of workload you throw at it, and it's an absolute beast when it comes to gaming that shouldn't need any kind of upgrade for many years to come (but there's plenty of room for expansion just in case).Please help me give this machine a good home! This thing is a steal considering all the top tier components, it would cost you more than $2700 to buy all the same parts right now according to the lowest prices available on PCPartPicker - and then you'd still have to put it together yourself. So I'm offering a nice discount on the hardware, and basically giving my professional level labor away for free.Please don't insult me with lowball offers, I know that this machine is worth more than I'm asking, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers. You have to see this machine in person, you will want to adopt it into your family."

39123258,Surface 3 128GB - 4GB Ram - $500 OBO w/ Pen & Keyboard Cover, Laptops,"I'm selling my Surface 3 since I will be graduating and getting a new computer from my work. This thing has been great companion for classes, particularly math and science courses that require complicated notation. This thing really shines in taking handwritten notes in OneNote that are searchable and indexable. Nothing like having the teacher change something on black/whiteboard, watching everyone erase or scribble furiously while you just select, move, and edit the notes digitally.Other pluses have been the portability and media use. The battery life has been fantastic, easily going all day for me, sometimes more as I just leave it in my bag for the next day and it still has enough juice. By media use, the screen is bright and the audio is loud. When it comes to Netflix on the couch with my wife, the Surface is the go to machine.For technical details, it has 4 GB of RAM (a minimum these days) and a 128 GB drive that has been plenty. The limiting factor is the Intel Atom processor, which means that running computationally intensive things are not going to be super quick (Meaning my multi-threaded programming assignments need to be done elsewhere, if that's what you need ;), but for the normal college life, this machine has been great. I am the original owner. I worked with Microsoft as an intern last summer, and it was a gift from them. The machine itself is Silver, and the keyboard and pen it comes are black. All look like new, no scratches on the frame or screen or anything. Let me know if you have any questions, and or if you want all your note-taking dreams come true!"

Enjoy up to 12 times the speed and 4 times the coverage of a wireless G network.

The compact 300Mbps Wireless Easy-N-UpgraderTM is designed around ease of use, performance and environmental friendliness. The latest in wireless encryption ensures wireless security.

38170729,Netgear WPN824 V2 Wireless MIMO Router, Laptop Hardware and Accessories ,"Netgear WPN824 V2 Wireless Nimo RouterThe NETGEAR WPN824 RangeMax Wireless Router lets you easily set up a wireless network in your home so you can share a single internet connection with everyone in your household or office at speeds up to 108 Mbps. Using MIMO technology, the access point offers superior range and eliminates ""dead spots"" in your home or office.The WPN824 has an elegant design with no unsightly antennas. View larger.Beautiful Design and Easy SetupThe WPN824 is a very attractive unit with a white exterior and rounded edges. An included plastic stand lets you stand the router on its edge to take up less space. Since the antennas are built in, there are no protrusions extending out of the case, maintaining a clean, elegant form factor. A vertical stand is included for more placement options.The WPN824 makes it easy for even a novice to set up a wireless network: just plug the included Ethernet cable from your DSL modem, cable modem, or other network connection into the router. An installation wizard guides you through the setup process step-by-step.The WPN824 employs a web-based interface for configuration, and the router will automatically do the initial setup by getting your DNS settings and determining your IP address. The firmware is also upgradeable via the web interface so you can be sure your router will always be up-to-date.Fast and SecureThe WPN824 supports the 802.11g standard but extends it with Smart MIMO technology that incorporates intelligent internal antennas, allowing it to detect interference from home devices such as microwaves, and adjusting itself accordingly. The upshot is speeds up to 108 Mbps with a longer range and a lack of ""dead zones"" in your home. When used with NETGEAR's adapters, it can provide up to 500,00 square feet of uninterrupted coverage. You will see the difference when you download music, stream video, or make internet telephone calls. If you still have computers that use 802.11b, don't fret as the router is backwards compatible with the older wireless standard and can be set so all your computers can connect to the network and the WGR614 will automatically figure out the connection type and work accordingly.Smart MIMO technology automatically adapts for interference from devices such as cordless phones and microwaves.In addition to wireless access, there are four 10/100 Mbps RJ-45 Ethernet ports in the back for connecting computers to the network via a fast wired connection.The WPN824 offers many security options to ensure your data is private. Double firewall protection keeps your network shielded from outside attacks and Network Address Translation (NAT) hides your PCs and files from outside snoopers. To ensure the security of your wireless data, both 40/64-bit and 128-bit WEP encryption is available, as well as WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access). You can also use MAC address authentication to allow only authorized users onto the network and Wireless Access Control (SSID) to identify authorized wireless network devices.Keep Tabs on KidsThis router is an especially good choice for parents as it allows settings to log all sites that are visited, lets you block specific sites based on whether it contains specific keywords, and lets you set time schedules for certain computers to work. Bought this new a while back and never used it. Comes complete with all the original boxed materials minus the box itself. Interested call or text Glenn at 801-556-6667."

39249083,Gaming Computer at bargain price!, Desktops,"I reduced the price to $649! Needs to go.

The computer is amazing and I have played modern Unity games such as Unity just fine on it. It has many an upgraded CPU fan, a super efficient-yet-quiet fans on one side. Follows is an overview:

Intel core i5 3.4Ghz
EVGA nVidia GeForce GTS 250
16gb of Crucial Ballistix RAM (low profile versions!)
250gb SSD
2 TB, 7200 RPM 64MB Cache Ultrastar Hard Drive (Yes, the kind servers use--fast, reliable, durable)
Cooler Master CM Storm QuickFire TK Wired Mini Keyboard
430W power supply
UPS with 4+ outlets
24"" monitor
6 USB 3.0 ports
CD DVD Reader
Windows 10 Home (for additional $70)

According to PC Part Picker, the total build consumes just 191W. The power supply can push out more than that, so there is room for swapping out for a a higher-powered graphics card!

For specifics of the build, you can visit https://pcpartpicker.com/user/bean5/saved/#view=m68V3C. 

If you don't want the graphics card, I can drop the price. Same goes for the monitor. Also, since I want to keep my data, I'll probably just buy you a new hard drive rather than wiping my data off this one. Yes, I will buy a new 2TB drive for this--or drop the price for you accordingly.

Text for more information. Questions are welcome. Asking $649 negotiable."

39098203,(OBO) GTX 980 SuperClocked ACX 2.0, Desktop Hardware and Accessories,"(I've been asked about the card's price point a lot lately. It is a Super Clocked card 300 MHz over base clock. The reason it's priced in this bracket is because of it's ability to overclock so well. Silicon transistors, for those of you curious, fire at different rates giving certain GPU owners ""the luck of the draw"" when it comes to overclocking. These type of cards are cherry picked from distributors to be overclocked over other cards of its same model. This card doesn't have more in it than any regular 980, but it is computes much faster. Sorry if the previous advertisement confused anyone.)BACKGROUND: I have had this card for 9 months. I have a three screen setup and this card gets me about 40-50 fps on GTA 5. But, in other games like rocket league, pushes 100+ fps. In games like Batman Arkham Origins gets upward of 120 fps. It is a great card! But I'd like to push the envelope a little more than that so I'm opting for a 980 ti for a little performance boost. I've posted a similar card in the past from my SLI configuration and that card was sold for $425. Now that the card is about a year old I figure the $410 mark is acceptable. The card itself is in great condition and, apart from not being dusted too often, it is practically untouched.

38316132,IN PACKAGE PALM / TUNGSTEN / E, Palm,"MAKE OFFERLocal inquiries IN UTAH ONLY  THXDesigned to support real life, this Palm Tungsten E Handheld processes business and personal data at dizzying speeds, and tracks the details so you don't have to. It pairs a sizeable 32MB of memory with a high-resolution 320x320 transflective color screen, which makes working on the go truly feasible. It can be used to create and edit Word, Excel and PowerPoint files, and synchronizes with Outlook's calendar, contacts, tasks, notes and e-mail. Updated organization software with a new agenda view and color-coded calendar help you customize your scheduling and stay productive. After hours it keeps you tuned in to your personal interests with an MP3 player, video and photo viewing. Features a 5-way navigator for 1-handed operation, and a Palm expansion slot that allows you to add extra memory or content; supports Secure Digital/Secure Digital IO/MultiMediaCards. PIM applications include calendar, contacts, memos and tasks. A powerful ARM processor lets you listen to MP3s while operating the scheduler or computer applications. Ample memory leaves plenty of room to customize with software for thousands of applications (sold separately). Accepts 3.5mm stereo headphone plug for MP3 and video playback. Includes Palm desktop 4.6 ounces, the Tungsten E is lighter than its forbearers despite being about the same dimensions as the m515 (4.5 x 3.1 x 0.5 inches). The ultra-slim Tungsten E isn't as curved as its m500 or V series predecessors, but we found the gentle slope near its base to be quite comfortable in the hand. The stylin' case is fully metallic and feels very durable. software for Windows and Macintosh, Microsoft Outlook conduits, and software essentials CD with Documents to Go Professional Edition, Adobe Acrobat Reader, powerOne personal calculator, RealOne Mobile Player, Handmark Magic Dogs, Handmark Mobile DB, Handmark PDA Money, Kinoma Player and Producer, Palm Photos, Palm Reader, VersaMail 2.6, Telephony/SMS, Phone Link, Phone Link Updater and Palm Dialer.

Compatible with Windows 98/2000/Me/XP or Mac OS 9.1 or higher and OS X 10.1.2 to 10.2.6. 4-1/2Lx3-1/10Wx1/2D"".From the ManufacturerIf you're still tapping away on a Palm Vx, it's time to upgrade to the 21st century with the brightly colorful, expandable, and powerful--not to mention affordable--Palm Tungsten E. Designed for the budget-conscious, yet still stylish professional, the Tungsten E offers several key advances over even the m500 handheld series, including:Palm OS 5.2.1 enhances Palm applications such as Calendar and Contacts as well as Java application support.Multimedia audio support and headphone jack enables you to use the Tungsten E as an MP3 playerThe zippy 126 MHz Texas Instruments OMAP311 ARM processor induces whiplash when switching programs.A 32 MB RAM memory (28.3 MB user accessible) adds more room for applications, while the expansion slot enables access to MP3and video files, e-books, games, and more.Best of all, the Tungsten E ups the display ante with a bright, crisp, high-resolution 320 x 320 pixel color screen (the m515 only offered a 160 x 160 resolution) that puts it on par with Sony's high-quality Clie screens. Your family snapshot slideshows look sharper, as do graphically intense games such as Monopoly and downloaded video (like the most recent Hollywood movie trailer).The Tungsten E offers a powerful array of multimedia options. With the included Kinoma Player (and desktop Kinoma Producer software), you can convert a myriad of video file formats (from QuickTime and Flash to AVI and MPEG) to be played on the Palm OS. And now you don't need to fumble between your PDA and portable MP3 player, thanks to the included RealOne Player for Palm. MP3 files are stored on optional Secure Digital or MultiMedia (MMC) memory cards, and we recommend purchasing a 128 MB card if you plan to access a lot of audio. You can listen to music via headphones or relive the '70s using the tinny, AM radio-like built-in speaker."

(That's why I specifically purchased this model as opposed to the 2014 flavors).So if you're a graphic designer, editor, student, or just love having an Apple computer, this  one will easily surpass your needs to keep you working efficiently!In addition to the computer, I'll be including an Incase Neoprene sleeve ($40) with the laptop, as well as the wall adapter with extension cable and removable plug.Serious inquiries only please! Cash or Venmo only! Price is FIRM. The 11"" Macbook Airs from the same year with the same specs sell for as much as $600, and this specific model of Macbook Air sells for as much as $780. This price with the sleeve is more than fair. ."

38701079,EVGA GeForce GT 430, Desktop Hardware and Accessories,"I've got a fully functioning EVGA GT 430 that I replaced with an R9 270X a few months ago. It's perfect for an HTPC build, but can hold its own quite well in games, especially more casual titles. I've been able to get Burnout Paradise running on high settings in full HD at ~60 fps.It has had problems with overheating in the past, but I've re-seated the heatsink several times and it now has no problem running FurMark (putting a full load on the GPU) for at least 5 minutes after hitting 100 C without rising past that. Minecraft and Burnout Paradise let it run quite a bit cooler than that, and idle temps are a lot lower.This model has a 700 MHz base clock, 96 CUDA cores, 1 GB of GDDR3 VRAM, PCIe 2.0 x16, and has 1 each of VGA, DVI-I, and HDMI 1.4a connectors. Full specs can be found here: http://www.evga.com/Products/Specs/GPU.aspx?pn=398FB600-FE34-4593-93BE-C46E5CC2B2B2I've lost track of it's original packaging, but I'll include an anti-static bag and a VGA cable if you'd like.

I would be willing to trade for working power tools (like a reciprocating saw, air compressor, brad nailer, or impact wrench) or good audio equipment (like mic cables, microphones, etc.).If you buy this unit, just for fun, I'll throw in a Sony Clie PEG-NZ90/U personal organizer for free.  This model is one of the first of the higher-tech PDA designs with the flip-screen.  Comes with a padded case, sync/charger stand, power cord, and a memory stick. For image and specs, see http://www.amazon.com/Sony-Clie-PEG-NZ90-Handheld/dp/B000087L74/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1433609992&sr=8-1&keywords=clie+nz90 Call or e-mail only.

36713764,Intel Laptop Pentium 6000 Processor, Laptop Hardware and Accessories ,"Intel Pentium P6000 is the second, after U5400 model, mobile Pentium microprocessor based on 32nm Arrandale core. The processor was introduced in June 2010 along with Core i3-370M, Core i5-450M and three new Core i7 Mobile models. The Mobile Pentium P6000 operates at 1.86 GHz, has 3 MB of shared level 3 memory, and supports only very basic features on enhanced Nehalem microarchitecture, such as EM64T and Disable-execute bit. The processor does not support Turbo Boost or HyperThreading technologies, nor does it support Virtualization technology. Like all Arrandale CPUs, the P6000 integrates graphics and memory controllers on a package. The graphics controller runs at 500 MHz, and, when necessary, can be boosted to 667 MHz. The memory controller provides support for DDR3 memory up to DDR3-1066. The CPU fits 35 Watt thermal envelope, and is manufactured only in micro-PGA socket 988 package.  Before the official launch, a few laptops with the Intel Pentium P6000 microprocessor were either announced, or their specifications popped up on the net. The laptops below will come with, or support the P6000:&#9726;Acer Aspire 4741ZG and eMachines E730&#9726;ASUS A52-series and K52-series notebooks&#9726;Lenovo G460, IdeaPad Z360 and IdeaPad Z560&#9726;Toshiba Satellite L630, L650-004 and L675-01P"

One is missing the battery cover, and there are light scratches (see pictures) but they are all extremely clean and in perfect working order.

These wireless keyboards are great for the home or office. They run on 2 AA batteries and will last for months before needed changed. They\'ll quickly connect to any Windows PC, Apple/Mac, laptop, desktop, phone or tablet that has bluetooth.

This Dell model has been my personal favorite for years because it is stylish and compact for a full-size keyboard. The media controls are also amazingly handy for controlling programs like Spotify. And there are dedicated shortcut buttons for calculator, explore, and web browsing that you didn\'t know you needed until you use them and can\'t go back to a keyboard without them!

I have four keyboards for sale, but if you\'d like to purchase just 1 or more let me know and we can work out a price.

39034601,"ASUS upgraded desktop, 16GB RAM, MSI R7 240 GPU, more...", Desktops,"This computer has been heavily upgraded from what it was when it was first purchased. Here is the original listing from Best Buy where it was purchased:http://www.bestbuy.com/site/asus-desktop-amd-a10-series-8gb-memory-1tb-hard-drive/8447977.p?id=1219334564775&skuId=8447977It was $499 brand new. So why am I asking only $100 less than retail for a one-year old PC?Because the only base specifications that remain unchanged are:* The CPU/APU which is an AMD A10 6700. The base speed is 3.7GHz, and it auto-turbos up to 4.3 GHz.* Networking, which included Ethernet Gigabit, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth connectivity.Everything else has been upgraded, including:* The original 8GB of RAM has been upgraded to 16GB.* An MSI Radeon R7 240 2GB GPU has been added. Decent for light gaming.* The power supply has been upgraded to a 650W Thermaltake model that includes 2 dual 6-pin PCI-E power connectors. This is because this machine used to have a GTX 970 installed for gaming. So if you want to added a beefier graphics card, this machine can handle it so long as a new GPU doesn't require 8-pin connectors (although such a card would probably come with adapters for 8-pins).* The standard CD/DVD player/burner has been replaced with a drive that can also READ (but not burn) Blu-Ray discs. You'll have to provide your own software, however, to play Blu-Rays (such as Cyberlink's PowerDVD).* In addition to the 1TB hard drive that came with the system, a second 2TB has been installed as well. This machine offers tons of storage.* The original machine came with Windows 8, which has since been upgraded to Windows 10 (Home Edition).A ""gaming"" keyboard and mouse set (leftofver from a CyberPowerPC machine and branded as such) are included. You'll need to provide your own display (HDMI, DVI, and VGA connections are all supported).I'm firm on the price. Cash and serious offers only, no trades. Call or text Dennis at (801) 560-0559. I can deliver this anywhere in the Salt Lake Valley and set it up for you (included in the price)."

Using wireless-AC technology, this router delivers speeds up to AC1200 Mbps (N300 + AC867). Wireless-AC offers gigabit Wi-Fi speeds that allow video and music files to stream and sync more quickly, allowing you to stream Netflix content to your HDTV while family members simultaneously download movies on a separate device or play online games–without waiting for content to buffer. The AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi Router is outfitted with a USB 3.0 port and four gigabit ports that let you connect multiple devices, allowing you to quickly print, share, and store content across your network.Beamforming Creates Stronger, Faster ConnectionsThe Linksys AC1200 Smart Wi-Fi router features beamforming, an innovative technology that optimizes the wireless signal and strengthens communication between specific devices and the router. Beamforming enables the router to identify and connect directly with other devices, rather than simply sending out wireless signals in a general direction. This results in faster network speeds, better wireless range, and reduced interference from other devices. It also helps extend the battery life of connected devices and reduce their power consumption because data is transferred more quickly.Manage Your Home Network Remotely with Linksys Smart Wi-FiWith Linksys Smart Wi-Fi, you can remotely access and control your home network anytime, using your smartphone, tablet, or computer. For example, you can set parental controls to restrict Internet access during certain times of the day and create unique, secure Wi-Fi passwords for your guests. You can also monitor activity on your home network, add new devices, and check upload and download speeds. In addition, Linksys Smart Wi-Fi allows you to prioritize which devices on your network receive the most bandwidth to reduce lag times and buffering when you're streaming HD media or gaming. Your Linksys Smart Wi-Fi account also gives you access to apps that provide additional ways to control and interact with your home Wi-Fi network. Block the Bad Stuff lets you add one of three levels of protective filtering to help safeguard your wireless network. Device Monitr allows you to monitor game consoles, tablet computers, and other devices, while NetProofer lets you restrict access to certain websites.Upgrade Your Devices to Enjoy the Full Benefits of Wireless-ACUsing Linksys's family of wireless-AC peripherals, you can take full advantage of the improved speed and stability of wireless-AC. Linksys Universal Media Connector lets you connect wired devices such as game consoles and smart TVs to your Wi-Fi network and stream HD or even 3D HD video content. The connector operates on the 5 GHz band, resulting in less interference and a clearer signal. Additionally, the Linksys Dual Band AC1200 Wireless 3.0 Adapter (WUSB6300) enables you to upgrade your laptop or desktop computer to fully benefit from the faster speeds of wireless-AC technology to stream high-definition video or enjoy high-speed gaming.RJ"

Thinner & Lighter
The iPad Air 2 is 18% thinner than its predecessor at 0.24"" and weighs just 0.96 lb. While lightweight, the Air 2 is still durable, thanks to its aluminum unibody construction.
Retina Display
Within the 9.7"" LED-backlit touchscreen, the 2048 x 1536 native resolution renders text and images at 264 pixels per inch and a total of over 3.1 million pixels. The display uses a 1-layer design, which eliminates gaps between layers, along with the internal reflections caused by those gaps. This results in richer colors, greater contrast, and sharper, more vivid images. The display also features a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating to keep your screen clean.
Touch ID
Your fingerprint is the perfect password. You always have it with you. And no one can ever guess what it is. Apple's Touch ID technology uses a unique fingerprint identity sensor to make unlocking your iPad easy and secure. Just put your finger on the Home button to unlock your iPad. Touch ID is capable of 360 degree readability, so no matter how you're holding it - portrait, landscape, or anything in between - your iPad knows who you are."

That's why I have this extra tower.The Phanteks Enthoo Luxe is an AWESOME full-tower ATX case. Huge window to show off all those sweet parts you bought, and select-color lighting on the exterior. Super mod-friendly; there's practically no rivets on the case - you can take just about everything off and do whatever you want. Space on the top for a slim radiator up to 140x420. Tons of space for fans, and EVERY possible intake has a filter. Tons of cable management behind the motherboard with lots of space and plenty of zip-tie points in addition to the many included velcro closures. PSU cover if you don't wanna spend stupid money on custom-sleeved cables. Great SSD compatibility - you can hide them behind the motherboard and take out all the 3.5"" cages for better airflow. Phanteks' product page can tell you way more though. Their pictures are better, too. :p http://www.phanteksusa.com/products/phanteks-enthoo-luxeOwned it a little over a year, it's still in great condition. There's paint missing where screws contact metal, but good luck avoiding that. Paint is in generally good condition, nothing outside of adult-owned use. I don't abuse my stuff. The acrylic has one noteworthy scratch in it, but is otherwi just used. Including the stock 200mm fan a stock 140mm fan, and one nice aftermarket 140mm. I've still got all the original internals: drive cages and PSU cover and whatever too. I'm happy to provide more pictures if you like. Price firm. Will consider water-cooling accessories (I have all the major parts) in trade with cash, but I'll be very picky.Call or text the number below to arrange a look-see or a sale. :)"

38563287,Custom Oil Cooled Desktop Computer Gaming intel nvidia pc, Desktops,"Before you read on, this computer is not for your regular person with regular computer needs. This is for computer/gaming enthusiasts looking for not only an incredible gaming machine that they have full control over, but also a piece of art and an awesome decoration. This computer was built by me and is submerged in pure mineral oil (non-conductive) for cooling and also just because its bad ass. The oil has a very high heat capacity so the computer wont even get warm until its been used for a few hours. It has lights installed inside the tank that you can change to 16 different colors. It also has an air pump mounted on top so you can pump air directly into the oil for when it does eventually get hot. I've never had the cpu or gpu get over 65c, most gaming computers run the cpu and gpu at 70-83c constantly. It has a real red oak lid and is completley silent with the air pump off. Oh and it is overclocked of course ;) and everything is unlocked so you can mess with the overclocking yourself. This machine is only two weeks old, just built it and tested it. Last but not least, the specs:Intel Pentium G3258 processor (anniversary edition), dual core, currently at 4.2mhz but is fine up to 4.8mhz if you keep an eye on the heatNvidia GTX 950 (Zotac dual fan edition) currently clocked to 1350mhz, but is stable up to 1550mhz!!G skill 8gb ram256 gb solid state hard drive (so you know it will be fast for years)Fresh copy of windows 10Also has a high speed wireless card for wifi.Here is a link to a video of it working:https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=1690437981233286&id=100008013006001This machine can handle all of the latest games at 1080p on ultra. Call or text (text prefferred) with any questions or offers. If you do want it I will siphon out the oil (100$ worth of mineral oil by the way) and put it back in gallon containers so you can transport it easily"

38964539,"27 in, i7, Brand new gaming SOLID STATE HYBRID, upgraded RAM, REDUCED PRICE", Apple Laptops,"27 inches! Quad core intel i7 processor that supports turbo boost and hyperthreading I just added a beast gaming solid state hybrid 1tb drive to this imac. This has upgraded ram at a total of 8gbs. It has a Radeon HD 4850 Graphics card. Has a built in FaceTime webcam and microphone and pretty good built-in speakers. The built in display is 2560X1440 and can support a second monitor at higher. A perk that this model has over others is that it can be used as an extended monitor as well so you could hook up your Xbox or other console/computer to it and play on this screen and then unplug it and its a kick butt computer again. Originally spent $2,199 on this computer but i have put a lot more into it. A new one of these from a normal retailer averages around $1,200 and I have added better specifications so this is a steal. It matches almost all the specs of the newest imacs but its in a Late 2009 model. Also comes with Magic Mouse, Wireless Keyboard, Mini display port to HDMI cable, and if you want i can throw in a USB hub with 6 USB slots. Sad to see this go but my family likes windows format better so we rarely use this. Text preferred but email and calls work too. Leave a voice message if i don't pick up because i'm always at school or soccer. Thanks for looking!"

It is an older router but has all the wireless functionality you'll need and then some.$20 - Netgear WNDR 3700 (N600), another good router we used for about 18 months. I did swap out the firmware on this router to DD-WRT and it works much better than the factory firmware. This is a more advanced router firmware and you should only purchase it if you're comfortable setting up the router manually.$20 - Netgear WNR2000 V3 (N300), this is a good solid router I found in a friends storage shed. When I found it it still had the plastic covering protecting it. It is not using the original cord but it still works just fine with the one I found for it.$100 - Linksys WRT1200AC, I purchased this router last year in October and it's only seen about 4 months use. This is a very good router that I intended to drop a custom firmware on but never got around to it.$60 - Linksys AC1200 Wireless Range Extender, this range extender was purchased at the same time as the Linksys Router and was also only used for about 4 months. It is a great way to extend the range of your wireless signal in large homes as well as to outside patios and other areas.I am more than happy to assist you in setting these wireless devices up in your home for an additional $25 for up to an hour.Please call or text Ellis at 801-647-8019 if you're interested in any of these wireless devices."

It also has undermount speaker clips as well as power if you'd like to use a speaker bar with it.The blue line of pixels is pictured. I actually used this monitor on my system for a few months - the blue line can easily be ignored, as it is only a single pixel wide. It also disappears when the image on the screen is white, and you can see it most clearly against a black background.

David Peyregne, the owner and respected computer and video game console repairman has decided to retire and train someone to take over the store and the repairs.Included with the sale of the business is everything the new owner needs to just walk in and take over their new business! A turnkey business in a box with over 3000 established and loyal customers and several business accounts that rely upon Computers For Less to help with repairs.Complete training for the new owner and employees is included as well as introductions to the business account partners that will supply business every week.  All inventory currently in the store and some furniture will be included in the asking price.  The sale price of the business is negotiable but David needs $3000  for start up cost for his new business endeavor.Before his stroke David was earning $1000 per week at this business.  Now he cannot work as fast,(the stroke left him paralyzed on his left side)but he can easily train a new owner to do exactly what he was doing.  Only a moderate working knowledge of computers and Windows operating systems is required, we don't work on Macs here.  Training will also be furnished for xbox,playstation and Wii repair which is about half of the business.For more detailed information about the business model and what you can do here, please come in to talk to David at Computers For Less, 659 N.

So I should mention that the majority of the repair machinery and the inventory has already been liquidated, There is enough small equipment left to complete the required training for all the repairs.  Essentially, what I am offering with the sale of this business is the knowledge and training for an interested party to run and operate their own established and sustainable business.  That's a good deal for only $3000.00.  However, if you think this asking price to high, I am willing to consider lesser reasonable offers.  Like the saying goes,""teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime.""  This is what I'm offering, the opportunity to learn and run your own profitable business that you can earn good money with as long as you care to.If you have any questions please call Dave at:801-369-7164"

38896286,Dell Vostro 3555 Notebook, Laptops,"Review Dell Vostro 3555 NotebookSiggy Moersch (translated by Vinay Pradhan), 10/06/2011Back in Black. Dell is currently offering the Vostro 3555, the new member of the existing Vostro family, for around 500 Euros. The black 15.6 inch model is equipped with a quad-core CPU, 6 GB RAM and the Radeon HD 6620G graphics chip. A special highlight of the notebook is the backlight keyboard which makes typing in the dark easy.The Dell  Vostro 3555 with AMD Vision technology is a new addition to the existing Vostro series. This notebooks employs the AMD A8-3500M CPU which has an integrated graphics chip. This graphics chip takes care of all of the laptop's graphics. The quad-core processor has a standard clock frequency of 1.5 GHz and activating the ""Turbo"" mode can boost the clock speed of the processor and coax more performance out of the unit. The Vostro 3555 has a 15.6 inch anti-glare display which runs at a native resolution of 1366x768 pixels. Our test model also has 6 GB RAM, a 2.5 inch hard disk with a capacity of 750 GB and a DVD burner. Dell has intalled a full HD webcam in this model as well. The RAM size and modules of our test model are unusual: two different modules are installed - a 4 GB Samsung module and a 2 GB Micron module.The Dell Vostro 3555 costs around 499 Euros (including taxes).CaseStylish 15 inch model from DellStylish 15 inch model from DellThe case of our test model is almost identical to that of its Intel-based predecessor: the Vostro 3550. The main difference between the two models is the case color; instead of red, Dell has picked a smooth platinum mix with a little copper for the Vostro 3555.Our test model has a plain yet attractive exterior. All of its inside surfaces are matt black. The keyboard and the touchpad each have a silver border which sets them apart from their immediate surroundings and adds style to the laptop.Closing the laptop transforms the matt black device into a laptop with an exquisite brushed aluminium design. The display cover, the sides and about half the bottom of the notebook are made of brushed aluminium. The reliable material provides the laptop the necessary sturdiness.The display cover can be forced inwards at certain spots. For example, near the middle of the display (in the area of the Dell logo), the cover can be pushed inwards. Thankfully, the cover proves to be sufficiently resistant and prevents the user from pushing all the way through to the panel. The two hinges hold the display well, but the screen still trembles slightly when the base of the laptop is moved.The base unit is even sturdier than the display cover: all the parts here sit well and do not squeak or move. The hand-rest regions, the keyboard, and the touchpad are all quite resistant to force. The surfaces did not give way under pressure, except near the optical drive, where the material can be pushed inwards slightly. Overall, the workmanship of the notebook is decent. We did not notice any faults in the design. The display can be easily opened, and clatters slightly when closed as Dell has not installed a locking mechanism.The Dell Vostro 3555 weighs (including the 6 cell battery) around 2.47 kgs. The power adapter adds another 390 grams to that figure. The measurements of the laptop are 35x375x260 mm, and the laptop is thinnest near the front -  30.4 mm.ConnectivityOur test model has ports on all sides, except the front (like in the predecessor: the Vostro 3550) and all the interfaces are positioned well. A total of three USB 3.0 ports are available on the laptop. Each side (the back, right and left side) has one USB 3.0 interface. The laptop also offers an ExpressCard 34mm slot, a DVD burner, two audio jacks (1x headphones, 1x microphone) on the right side. On the left side, a cardreader, an eSATA/USB2.0 combo interface and a HDMI interface are placed. A RJ45 LAN port and a VGA interface can be found on the back. The positioning is quite good, and the user can use any port without the fear of blocking any of the bordering ports.The front of the laptop has not ports, and notebook lacks a docking port interface on the bottom.Front side: no ports/jacksFront side: no ports/jacksLeft side: USB 3.0, HDMI, eSATA/USB combo interface, CardreaderLeft side: USB 3.0, HDMI, eSATA/USB combo interface, CardreaderBack side: RJ45 (LAN), USB 3.0, VGA, Power outletBack side: RJ45 (LAN), USB 3.0, VGA, Power outletRight side: ExpressCard, DVD burner, Audio In/Out, USB 3.0Right side: ExpressCard, DVD burner, Audio In/Out, USB 3.0CommunicationThe user can use the RJ-45 port on the back (Gigabit-LAN) for a wired internet connection or the Wireless-LAN module (802.11 b/g/n) to surf wirelessly on the web. The laptop also has Bluetooth 2.0+EDR. Sadly, a 3G-/UMTS-compatible modem is not installed.SecurityThe Vostro 3555 offers extensive security functions. The laptop has a fingerprint scanner which allows the user to use biometric protection for the computer log-in. The fingerprint scanner can also be used with the DigitalPersona software for other log-ins, such as an email client. The anti-virus protection offered by Dell consists of McAfee Security Center and Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security Service, which is free for 15 months. In addition, Dell also has Absolute Data Protect, in the form of LoJack (starter version), pre-installed. After registration (which requires payment) the laptop can be traced if lost.AccessoriesInput DevicesKeyboardThe keyboard of the Vostro 3550 is identical to that of our test model as it also has background lighting. This features allows the user to clearly discern the characters on the keyboard even in the dark.One of the highlights of the Dell Vostro 3555 is the backlight keyboard (right with backlight and left without)One of the highlights of the Dell Vostro 3555 is the backlight keyboard (right with backlight and left without)Smooth touchpad, without any surface designSmooth touchpad, without any surface designTouchpadA big touchpad with a black surface is placed in front of the keyboard of our test model. The touchpad supports multi-finger input and gestures like the touchpad of the Vostro 3550.The touchpad has two keys which serve as the right and left buttons of a mouse. The user can easily deactivate the touchpad by pressing ""Fn+F3"". The user is automatically notified by the computer when the touchpad is de-/activated (by a pop-up on the screen) and a LED above the touchpad turns on when the device is off.WebcamThe 2 megapixel HD webcam is placed in the top center of the 15.6 inch display and it can take pictures and videos.The 15.6 inch display has a limited opening angleThe 15.6 inch display has a limited opening angleDisplayOur test model has a 15.6 inch display, which has a resolution of 1366x786 pixels and an aspect ratio of 16:9. The screen is anti-glare which means that it does not have annoying reflections. External monitors/TVs can be connected to the notebook via the VGA (on the back) or HDMI (on the left side) interface. The panel used in our test model is named the AUO23EC. This is a different panel than the one tested in Intel-based Vostro 3550 (LGD02E3).The integrated AMD Radeon HD 6620G chip of the CPU is responsible for the graphic output. Unfortunately, this graphics chip lacks its own VRAM (video memory), and as such must use the installed main memory modules.Distribution of brightnessGossen Mavo-MonitorMaximum: 180 cd/m� Average: 170.8 cd/m�Brightness Distribution: 91 %Center on Battery: 125 cd/m�Contrast: 189:1 (Black: 0.87 cd/m�)ICC File (Datacolor Spyder3Elite)This is how a pure black picture appears on the screen of the Vostro 3555.This is how a pure black picture appears on the screen of the Vostro 3555.We measured 9 fixed data points on the display while it was set to maximum brightness. The values ranged between 164 to 180 cd/m� (the average lies at 170.8 cd/m�). The illumination of the display is 91 percent. These values indicate that the panel is much darker than the panel of the Vostro 3550.We measured the contrast while the display was at maximum brightness. The contrast of the panel lies at 189:1 and black value is 0.87 cd/m�.We noticed that the top corners and the bottom screen edge of the display were distinctly brighter when the screen was showing a black picture. This effect seemed like a ""Bad Smiley"" and affected the overall viewing experience negatively especially when watching dark sequences in videos.The colors are displayed quite well by the panel. Sadly, the measured color space falls far short of the professional Adobe-RGB and sRGB color spaces. Color space comparison via Dell Vostro 3555The display delivers an acceptable picture outdoors in direct sunlight. The contents of the 15.6 inch screen were clearly legible and the colors of our test video were also clearly visible. The brightness fell noticeably, but this should not hinder users while writing a mail or doing office work as these tasks usually use a brighter background. As such the user will be able to stand this effect, even though longer periods of use will strain his/her eyes. The stable viewing angles of the display are severely limited. The content on the screen is displayed with strong colors and good contrast as long as the user is sitting right in front of the screen. However, as soon as the user changes position, the picture inverts or brightens up.When the display is turned to an angle of +45 degrees or -45 degrees the content of the screen no longer remains recognizable. At these angles, the content displayed by the screen is too inverted or bright, making it impossible for us to recognize the contents. PerformanceThe Dell Vostro 3555 uses a quad-core CPU from AMD. The A8-3500M with AMD Vision runs at 1.5 GHz (32-nm production processor with 1000 million transistors on a DIE size of 218 mm�) and has a 4 MB Level 2 cache. The APU (Accelerated Processing Unit) can work on four threads simultaneously and has Turbo core 2.0 (equivalent to Intel's Turbo boost technology). When this ""Turbo"" mode is activated the CPU speeds up to 2.4 GHz. This means that the respective cores of the APU can be easily overclocked as long as there is sufficient cooling.The A8-3500M also contains the memory controller and the graphics chip.The Vostro 3555 hit 2085 points in Cinebench R10 (Single Rendering - 64 bit mode) which places it at the same level as a Core i3 2357M @ (operating at) 1.3 GHz or an Athlon II P340 @ 2.2 GHz. In the Multi Rendering test (64 bit) of the same benchmark, the test model reached 6852 points. This score is comparable to the performance delivered by an AMD Phenom II X4 P960. The test model scored 1.88 points in the latest Cinebench R11.5 benchmark (CPU 64 bit calculations).The laptop reached 5030 points in the PC Mark Vantage. The score is not as bad as it seems when compared to the performance of an Intel Core 2 Duo P7550 or an AMD Phenom II X4 P960. In PC Mark 7 (the latest benchmark) the test model reached a score of 1634 points.In our direct comparison with the previously tested Vostro 3550, we noted that our test model scored far lower. On average, the Dell Vostro 3555 scored 56% lower than its predecessor (the Vostro 3550) in Cinebench R10. However, this is probably due to the stronger Core i7 2620M (@2.7 GHz) in the Vostro 3550. Even in PC Mark Vantage (-35%) and PC Mark 7 (-20.6%) our test model scored lower. 5.8Windows 7 Experience IndexProcessorCalculations per second6.6Memory (RAM)Memory operations per second7.3GraphicsDesktop performance for Windows Aero5.8Gaming graphics3D business and gaming graphics6.5Primary hard diskDisk data transfer rate5.9PCMark Vantage Result	5030 pointsPCMark 7 Score	1634 pointsHelp... in comparisonOur test model uses the graphics chip integrated in its APU for its graphic output. The model's integrated graphic chip is the AMD Radeon HD 6620G which supports DirectX 11 and supposedly performs at the same level as a mobility Radeon HD 5650 middle-class graphic card. In addition, the AMD graphics chip is supposedly much faster than the Intel integrated HD Graphics 3000 chip which is used by second generation Core i-processors.In the Futuremark benchmarks, the graphic and 3D performance of the AMD Radeon HD 6620G lay at the expected levels: 15023 points (3D Mark 2001SE), 10589 points (3D Mark 03), and 7033 points (3D Mark 05). The Dell notebook performed especially well in 3D Mark 06: 4053 points. Finally, in the latest Futuremark graphics benchmark, the 3D Mark 11, the integrated graphics solution scored 809 points.Against a Radeon HD 5650 the integrated graphics chip of the A8-3500M processor loses by around 29.4% on average (3D Mark 2001SE: - 26,4%, 3D Mark 03: - 40%, 3D Mark 05: - 28%, 3D Mark 06: - 43,7%, 3D Mark 11: - 9,7%).When we compared the graphics performance of both Vostro models (the 3550 and the 3555) we noticed that the successor has lower graphics performance. The Vostro 3550 uses a Radeon HD 6630M, whereas the 3555 employs a Radeon HD 6620G. The benchmark results indicate that the Vostro 3555 scores on average 31% lower than the Vostro 3550.In our direct comparison, we noticed that the AMD Radeon HD 6620G performs around 13.6 percent better (clear increase) than the integrated HD Graphics 3000 (second generation Core i- series).3DMark 2001SE Standard	15023 points3DMark 03 Standard	10859 points3DMark 05 Standard	7033 points3DMark 06	4053 points3DMark 11 Performance	809 pointsHelp... in comparisonStress testThe core temperatures of the four cores of the A8-3500M CPU barely rose during our stress test (high load on CPU and GPU using prime95 and Furmark).  The clock frequency of the processor wavered slightly in the region of 1.5 GHz, and Turbo mode was barely used. The clock frequency fell down to 200 MHz for a short while. In our 90 minute stress test, the standard clock frequency (@1.5 GHz) of the APU remained constant almost the entire time.HDD PerformanceGaming Performance VerdictThe integrated graphics of the A8-3500M-Prozessors (AMD Radeon HD 6620G) performed well on all the tested games. In ""Dirt 3"", ""Trackmania Nation Forever"" and ""Fifa 11"", the integrated AMD graphics could deliver up to 170 fps (frames per second) at a resolution of 800x600 pixels. With a 1024x resolution, the performance dropped: Dirt 3 at 36 fps was still ""playable""). Fifa 11 and TMN performed better and could be run in all resolutions. The demanding ""Mafia 2"" game ran on the test model with a 800x pixel resolution at 35 fps. In comparison: a HD Graphics 3000 (integrated graphics chip of the Sandy Bridge processors) could only run Mafia 2 at 9 frames per second in a resolution of 800x600 pixels.To see which games run on the AMD graphic chip and how well they run, please take a look at our in-depth performance table which includes the latest games: ""Computer Games on Laptop Graphic Cards"".TMU: The ideal game to play on an integrated graphics chipTMU: Idealer Spielspa� f�r integrierte HD-GrafikDirft 3: Only runs at low resolutionsDirft 3: nur in geringer Aufl�sung gut spielbarFIFA11: Can be played at all resolutionsFIFA11: in allen Aufl�sungen gut spielbarMafia 2: Low frames - almost not ""playable""Mafia 2: Fast nicht spielbarlow	med.	high	ultra	Trackmania Nations Forever (2008)	120				fpsMafia 2 (2010)	35	30	26		fpsFifa 11 (2010)	170	96	60		fpsDirt 3 (2011)	59	36	24		fpsThe ventilation openings on the sides are the exits for the heat exhaust of the cooling system.The ventilation openings on the sides are the exits for the heat exhaust of the cooling system.EmissionsNoise EmissionsAlthough the Vostro 3555 does not run a very high-performance CPU (A8-3500M), the cooling fan is always running (even when idle). While idle, the noise emissions from the laptop were around 33.3 dB(a). The playing of a DVD caused the emission to jump slightly to 35.9 dB(a) (distance between laptop and measurement device - 15 cms). Even under full load, the laptop only emits 35.9 dB(a). The in-built hard disk runs quietly at 32.1 dB(a) despite the fast operating speed of 7200 rpm.The noise emissions have dropped in comparison with the predecessor.Noise LevelIdle	31.9 / 32 / 33.3 dB(A)HDD	32.1 dB(A)DVD	35.9 / dB(A)Load	33.3 / 35.9 dB(A)  	 30 dBsilent40 dB(A)audible50 dB(A)loud	 min: , med: , max:    Voltcraft sl-320 (15 cm distance)   environment noise: dB(A)TemperatureThe temperature emissions remain low during our tests. The Vostro laptop performed well thanks to its power-conservative CPU (AMD A-Series A8-3500M), and the temperatures of the 3550 remained well below its predecessor: the Vostro 3550. The laptop ran relatively cool even when the hardware was under full load - around 40.6 degrees Celsius (near the middle of the bottom of the notebook). Other laptops were breaking the 50 degrees limit under the same conditions. The surface remains cool in front of the keyboard and near the touchpad, reaching a maximum of 30.6 degrees Celsius.When the laptop is idle or when the user is doing some light office work or surfing on the web, the temperatures on the surface stayed at 29.5 degrees and at the bottom at 33 degrees Celsius.The power adapter had to deliver high performance during the stress test and it became relatively hot. The temperature measurements ranged from 53 degrees Celsius while the laptop was running under full load to 28.6 degrees Celsius while the laptop was idle.Max.

The speakers are hidden behind small openings in the notebook. Our quest to locate the speakers' exact location proved unfruitful. The sound emanates from below and the base of the laptop amplifies the sound. The sound output is good even when the speakers are turned up.Battery LifeThe power consumption of the Vostro 3555 in stand-by mode lies at 0.9 watts. Our measurement device showed the power consumption while switched off to be 1 W. When idle, the power consumption ranges between 9.1 to 13.3 watts. For our lowest reading, we had to put the display at minimum brightness, switch off the WLAN, and turn on all energy-saving options. The second measurement was taken with maximum brightness, high-performance profile, and WLAN switched on. These values are low for a laptop using a quad-core CPU.The highest possible power consumption (full load, maximum brightness, no energy-saving, WLAN on) lies at 55.0 W.Power ConsumptionOff / Standby	 1 / 0.9 WattIdle	 9.1 / 16.2 / 16.3 WattLoad	 38.5 / 55 Watt Dell Extended Battery LifeThe battery of the Vostro 3555 has 6 cells like the one in the Vostro 3550. The Lithium-Ion battery lasted 1 hour and 23 minutes (minimum run time) in the first run of the ""Classic Test"" from BatteryEater. In the ""Readers Test"" (minimum display brightness, energy-saving options turned on) the battery ran for 348 minutes (5 hours and 48 minutes - maximum run time). The user can surf on the web via the WLAN without a power cable for 2 hours and 52 minutes. The laptop lasted 1 hour and 50 minutes while playing a DVD. Recharging the battery takes around 137 minutes (2h:17min).Interesting: although the system consumes less power and has a longer battery life while idle, the Intel-based Vostro 3550 still runs longer while surfing on the internet using the WLAN module or playing a DVD. It seems that the test model can not keep the power consumption as low in everyday use as it boasts.When closed the laptop catches the eye with its brushed aluminium surface in platinum, and when open a ""black pearl"" emerges. The display borders as well as the base of the laptop are made of black and matt aluminium. The keyboard and the touchpad are surrounded with a chrome border which accentuates the exquisite design further.The 15.6 inch HD (High Definition) monitor is backlit and has a native resolution of 1366x768 pixels. The display is anti-glare (matt) which means that users will not be distracted by a myriad of reflections. On the inside of the laptop, an AMD quad-core processor (A8-3500M) runs with its integrated graphics chip (Radeon HD 6620G), 6 GBs of RAM (1x 4 GB + 1x 2 GB) and a 750 GB hard disk. The hardware proved reliable and fast in our benchmarks with very low emissions. "

38159300,"Mid 2012, 13 inch Macbook Pro, 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB Ram, 750 GB Hard drive", Apple Laptops,"When a critical project is on the line at school or at work, you need a device that you know will take care of you. Few things are more frustrating than not having the right equipment in place during a time crunch. 

Apple products are not cheep, but time and time again, they deliver when you need them to the most. One thing I've noticed as I've compared this machine to my surface pro is that Apple has a ton of built in, free programs that Microsoft wants to charge me a couple bucks a month for (think PDF editing). 

If you're looking for a device that can take care of you or your loved one then you've found the right place. This is a Mid 2012, 13 inch, Macbook Pro with a 2.9 GHz Intel Core i7 processor and 8 GB of ram. Even though it's a few years old, in many ways it is still faster than my new, 2015 surface pro 4, which I paid a lot more than $1,000 for (I had to have a windows based computer for work). 

As you can see it has been taken care of very well, and comes with a few extras: 3 power cables and cubes that can be stored at different places so you're never without one, the original box, decals, instructions, and a cable that allows you to connect to a TV or monitor through the HDMI (this cable is temperamental, but still works). There is minor wear and tear on the underside of the device, but nothing on the top or inside; furthermore, it is very, very clean and well taken care of. 

If you'd like to come see the machine please let me know. I have wiped it clean of all my information, but I have used it a time or two since then (I keep finding things that it can do that my surface pro can't). I'd be happy to re-wipe it clean for you before you pick it up though."

38849985,Saitek X52 HOTAS USB Flight Control System, Desktop Hardware and Accessories,"The Saitek X52 is a great mid/entry level flight control system for flight and/or space sim pilots. I used this unit for about a year and am looking to sell it since I upgraded my sim setup to a TM Warthog. This stick worked great for my favorite sims: DCS World, War Thunder, Elite Dangerous, FSX and Star Citizen. I've even heard this works for some PS4 titles as well, though I have never personally attempted this.

Unit is in full working condition, original packaging is included. All switches, control axes and rotaries are functioning as new. Control axes show no drift or non-linear input tracking. The joystick pitch/roll/yaw sensors return to center just fine, so there is no need to use dead zones. The unit has never been dropped or abused in any way. There are no visible blemishes or signs of wear. I babied the heck out of this stick.

Saitek also has great software (you can download the latest version on their website) for programming the stick. You can configure your own profiles, or download ready-to-use profiles made by other users. There is a lot of button real estate on this HOTAS. Using the programming software allows for upwards of 170 functions to be bound to the stick and throttle. That doesn't include the control axes, ministick and rotaries.

Looking to sell local to another sim enthusiast or future sim enthusiast. Price is $100. Send me a message if you have any questions."

39233371,EVGA GEFORCE GTX 650TI SC 2GB , Desktop Hardware and Accessories,"I am selling my 650ti from EVGA, it\'s super clocked, meaning that the base speed is boosted 130 mhz. I\'ve had this card for about a year and a half and it ran and still runs new titles at a decent setting at 45-60fps. For example: Battlefield 3 at ultra settings 55-60 Battlefield 4 at high settings 50-55 ArmA 3 most high settings 40-55 Rainbow 6 Siege at high w/ ultra mix 50-60 (depends on the map) Borderlands 2 at ultra 59-60 This is a pretty great card if you are trying to upgrade you pc without running into many compatability issues. One of the real issue is that you need at least a 400w powersupply with an available PCI-E 6pin power connector. Under load it\'s fairly quiet, however you can adjust the fan speed in PRECISIONX. I haven\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'t tried overclocking this card, but I believe you can squeeze more juice out of it.

They are extremely fast for surfing on the internet and streaming movies. The biggest advantage to this computer is it\'s portability and battery life. You can watch you tube videos or movies for eight to ten hours straight on one charge. Take it with you to work or school and use it all day without having to bring your charger with you. They are basically an improved version of a chrome book, the difference being a chrome book uses a shrunk down version of Windows where these run full Windows 10. Factory reset.

It has the wrong box and fan shroud on it when I bought it, but it is a GTX 980 and posts in my pc as a GTX 980.

It's a great starter laptop for anyone interested in programing. I've been running Ubuntu on it most recently. It seems to run the smoothest. The CPU is based on a 2G RAM, Intel Core Duo L2400 / 1.66 GHz which will run turbo up to 2.7GHz. I've used it as my desktop as well (it'll run without the battery connected) with dual monitors. Most importantly, it's virtually indestructible with its frame and waterproof keyboard- never needed a case. Any drinks you spill on it are collected via a splash tray and drained out the bottom. Offers welcome. Text me with any questions. OBOIncludes battery and charging cable."

36929128,Small Dell Desktop Computer, Desktops,"This is a Dell USFF (Ultra Small Form Factor) Optiplex SX270. I have put a clean image of Windows XP on it with all of the updates except the XP end of life message. I use one like this attached to my Living Room TV to surf the Net & watch Amazon Prime & YouTube Videos. The Processor is an Intel Celeron 2.53 Ghz Proc with 512 MB of 240 pin RAM. It has a 40 GB Hard Drive with just under a 1/4 of it used. I have installed a new CMOS battery so it should last for many years. No Monitor, Keyboard & Mouse are included. You will just need to attach it to your TV (if it has a VGA input) or Monitor as well as a USB keyboard & mouse. I use a wireless keyboard & mouse on mine & it works great. This will work with Dual Monitors if you have a DVI input on one & a VGA input on the other one. There are DVI to HDMI Adapters available online if you want to use HDMI. I tried one of these adapters but no audio fed into the HDMI so I would have to use a stereo to listen to sound instead of the TV speakers. This would be a great 2nd Computer for kids to use or to use older programs that no longer work on Windows 7 or 8. Microsoft Office XP is included with the Compatibility Pack to work with the newer versions. This Computer is very small and quiet as well.

39206246,Console Killer Mid-Range Gaming PC, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers in the last year or so.This machine started out as a 'spare parts' build, but ended up actually being a very capable mid-range gaming PC. It's more powerful than a PS4 or XBone, with an Intel i5 quad core processor and a graphics card that can run most games on ultra settings at 1080p.Here are the full specs:Intel Sandy Bridge i5 2320 CPUIntel DP67DE mATX MotherboardCorsair XMS3 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 RAMCustom Modded Radeon 7970 3GBMyDigitalSSD BP mSATA 64GB SSDSeagate 1TB 7200RPM Secondary HDDEVGA 500B Power Supply (Brand New)Cougar Solution Midtower Chassis (Brand New)+ Genuine Windows 10 64 BitThe Intel Sandy Bridge i5 2300 CPU has four physical cores that clock at up to 3.3GHz, and even though it's a couple generations old now it's still plenty capable and more than you need for most games. It can even handle the more demanding cutting edge titles like Fallout 4, and it ranks in the second highest tier of CPUs for gaming in the overall hierarchy:http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.html(That being said, if you REALLY want an i7 at some point in the future for whatever reason, this motherboard can handle any of the Sandy or Ivy Bridge models, such as the 2700k or 3770k)The Radeon 7970 was AMD's top end graphics card from just a couple generations back, and as a testament to its capabilities they've continued re-using the same GPU for subsequent generations, rebranded as the R9 280X and R9 380X. That's right - it's essentially the same GPU as the 'new' R9 380X, just with a different name on it. This card will eat games like Starcraft II and League of Legends for breakfast, it's generally only newer FPS games or similar (GTAV, Witcher 3, Fallout 4, Star Citizen, etc.) that MIGHT need to have some of the settings lowered from ultra. Even for those titles, most of the benchmarks I've seen show this card pulling a very respectable ~30 FPS on average with everything cranked to the max.Furthermore, I've custom modded this card with awesome Cougar Hydrodynamic Bearing 120mm fans, which provide much better cooling than the stock fans it came with. The temps now stay nice and low with no noise increase under load - these fans stay quiet all the time. The extra thermal headroom also means you can overclock the card beyond it's stock capabilities very easily with the help of software like MSI Afterburner.As an additional note, most prebuilt machines like CyberPowerPC and IBuyPower, etc., often skimp on the graphics card even though it's the most critical component for gaming (they also generally use low quality power supplies and motherboards). It's important to understand the need for a balanced system that alleviates as many of the bottlenecks as possible.8GB of Corsair XMS3 DDR3 1600MHz RAM in dual channel isn't a ton of memory, but should be plenty for any game on the market right now and most general use cases. It's also one of the easiest things to upgrade if you decide you want more later, and there are two extra slots currently open for that purpose.For permanent storage, the MyDigitalSSD BP 64GB SSD serves as the OS drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Home 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE license). If you've never had a machine with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back. As for secondary storage, the 7200RPM Seagate 1TB HDD is where you'll be installing any programs too large or not important enough to go on the SSD, as well as storing user data like music and pictures.There's no DVD / optical drive installed internally as I've found most people don't use them any more, BUT if you want one I can include a brand new external USB DVD drive that will get the job done for an extra $10 or so.The EVGA 500W power supply is a solid, no frills unit. I've used the same model for several other machines, and it just works. I've also used the Cougar Solution chassis for a number of builds now, and it's a great case for the price. It has all the standard features, dust filters and cable management space and toolless drive mechanisms, etc, everything you expect in a quality enclosure. It has great ventilation to start with, and I took the liberty of installing a pair of extra blue LED 120mm fans up front as intakes.(Full Disclosure: One of the two front-panel USB ports came with a damaged cable and therefore doesn't work. However, the case is brand new and still under warranty if you want to try and get a replacement from Cougar. It would also be pretty easy to fix by splicing a spare connector onto the cable.)So there you have it. This machine is a steal for the price - it would run you nearly $800 to put together a machine with the same or comparable parts according to the lowest prices available on pcpartpicker.com, so I'm selling it for a good deal LESS than it would cost you to go out and build it yourself, and I'm essentially giving away my labor for free. A lot of ads on KSL claim that their machines are worth a lot more than they are, or they base the price on what they originally paid, but I follow the market very closely and do my research. I know this machine is worth more than I'm asking AND I can back it up with real data.Price is firm, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers though. You have to see this machine in action to fully appreciate it."
39206241,Skylake i5 + GTX 970 Gaming Thoroughbred, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell high quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.I built this machine to provide the best bang for your buck gaming performance using the latest CPU & GPU tech. It's able to run any game on the market with maxed out settings, and it meets the Oculus Rift requirements too. Almost every component in this machine is brand new, and the CPU and GPU were only lightly used.Here are the full specs:Intel Skylake i5 6400 CPUGigabyte GA-Z170-HD3 Motherboard (Brand New)Nvidia GTX 970 4GB GPU with Titan CoolerMushkin Enhanced Eco2 16GB (2x8GB) RAM (Brand New)OCZ Trion100 240GB SSD (Brand New)Toshiba 3TB 7200RPM Secondary HDD (Brand New)EVGA Supernova NEX 750W Modular Power Supply (Brand New)Thermaltake Urban R31 Chassis (Brand New)+ Genuine Windows 10 Professional 64 BitThe i5 6400 hails from Intel's latest and greatest Skylake line of CPUs, packing four physical cores that clock up to 3.3GHz. The Skylake chips have been in crazy high demand ever since their release, just getting your hands on one has been near impossible since launch, and only now is availability finally starting to improve.Now, there's a common misconception that you should get an i7 for gaming because, well... 7 is better than 5, right? But in truth an i7 is just an i5 with hyperthreading enabled (4 virtual cores added to the 4 physical) and a little extra cache, which generally only makes a difference in heavily threaded productivity software - even then it's only up to about a 20% improvement in the best case scenario. The extremely large majority of games out there don't even fully utilize 4 cores, much less any additional virtual cores from hyperthreading. There are a ton of benchmarks out there that will show gaming performance is identical in pretty much every scenario between an i5 and an i7, and I can corroborate this with my own testing. This machine cranks out the same FPS when benchmarked as the i7 rigs I've built with equivalent GPUs.All that being said, if at some point in the future you get really heavy into video editing or CAD or other software that would benefit from the extra virtual cores from hyperthreading, you could easily drop an i7 into this board, and it also supports overclocking if you get a K sku CPU. Furthermore, this board should also support Intel's future Kaby Lake and Cannonlake processors, so you've got plenty of upgrade options.Moving on to the GPU, Nvidia's GTX 970 offers roughly 90% of the performance of the beastly GTX 980 in most scenarios for a lot less money, and it can easily run any game on the market with settings maxed out at 1080p, including brand new titles like Battlefront and The Division. Many ads claim their PC can do this, but very few are running cards of this caliber. Want to play at higher resolutions? No problem, this card can handle 1440p admirably, and can even do 4k gaming to an extent. Google some benchmarks if you're uncertain, this thing will knock your socks off.Furthermore, this particular model of 970 comes directly from Nvidia and is the ONLY 970 out there sporting the phenomenal Titan cooler. It can only be purchased from Best Buy, and it carries a bit of a price premium over other 970s, but it's worth it. This cooler exhausts air out the back instead of recirculating it inside the case (unlike all the 3rd party GPU coolers) and boasts stellar performance, keeping the card at its designated threshold of 80 degrees with the fan running at only 50%. That means this rig doesn't make much noise even under full load, and you also have a ton of thermal headroom if you want to overclock this bad boy for extra performance. It even has a backplate for extra style and rigidity, something you normally have to spend $20 extra for and install yourself.16GB of brand new Mushkin Enhanced ECO DDR3L 1600 low voltage RAM means not having to worry about running out of memory, most games are more than fine on just 8GB. This leaves you plenty of leeway to be lazy about not closing your browser tabs and running other programs in the background while you play. There are also two slots still available on the motherboard if you want to add more memory at some point in the future, and the board can support up to a whopping 64GB in total.For storage, the brand new OCZ Trion100 240GB SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE license). If you've never had a machine with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back.Then for secondary storage, there's a brand new Toshiba 3TB 7200 RPM mechanical HDD to hold any games you don't want to store on the SSD, plus all your music and cat videos and whatever else you can think of. There's also plenty of room to add more drives later if you want to, and the motherboard supports both SATA Express and SATA3 in addition to the M.2 port.There's no DVD / optical drive installed since I've found most people don't use them any more, BUT if you want one I can include a brand new external USB DVD drive that will get the job done for an extra $10 or so. As an added note, I can also throw in a brand new basic keyboard and optical mouse for $10, but as peripherals are a highly subjective affair and also a hugely important part of your gaming experience, I strongly recommend buying some nicer ones that suit your personal preferences.The EVGA Supernova NEX 750W power supply provides more juice than you'll ever need for this rig - the GTX 970 is built on Nvidia's highly efficient Maxwell architecture, and the entire system should draw less than 300W even under full load. I'm kinda picky about power supplies, and I try to stick to Corsair, EVGA, or Seasonic built units for the most part. This particular model is also semi-modular, which means you only plug in the cables you actually need and cuts down on clutter inside the case.Finally, we have the Thermaltake Urban R31 chassis everything is built into. Of course it has all the features you'd expect from a high end chassis: easy access removable dust filters, excellent cable management, removable drive trays and cages, and so on. As an added bonus, it also sports a HDD docking port up top, which is super handy if you have extra drives and like to move your files around easily. I like the simple and elegant aesthetic as well, with a subtle brushed aluminum finish and an acrylic side panel window to show off the internals.So there you have it. This rig is a purebred gaming beast loaded with all the latest goodies, and it has plenty of options for future expansion should you ever need them. It would run you more than $1100 just to buy all the same parts according to the lowest prices available on pcpartpicker.com right now, and then you'd still have to put it all together yourself. So I'm selling it for LESS than it would cost you to go out and build it yourself and essentially giving away my professional-grade labor for free. Help me give this beastly machine a good home!Price is firm, I know this rig is worth more than I'm asking for it, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers though. You have to see this machine in person to fully appreciate it."

I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.This is a robust, capable machine that can handle multi-threaded productivity software, video / photo editing, and can also destroy pretty much any game on the market with the settings cranked up - WITHOUT destroying your wallet.Here are the full specs:AMD Vishera FX-8320 CPUZalman LQ-320 Liquid Cooler (Brand New)Asus M5A97 LE R2.0 MotherboardTwo XFX R9 280 DD 3GB Graphics Cards in CrossfireCorsair XMS3 16GB (4x4GB) DDR3 1600 RAMSandisk SSD Plus 240GB (Brand New)Western Digital Blue 1TB HDDXFX TS 750W Power Supply (Brand New)Ultra Rogue M925 Full Tower Chassis (Brand New)Cooler Master MegaFlow 200MM Fan (Brand New)+ Genuine Windows 10 Professional 64 BitAMD's hugely popular eight-core FX-8320 has a base speed of 3.5GHz per core with the ability to turbo up to 4GHz on its own, and it's an unlocked chip that can be cranked even higher. I haven't overclocked it, but I've mounted a Zalman LQ320 closed loop liquid cooler that keeps it frosty cool with some fantastically low temps, so you've got plenty of thermal headroom to overclock if desired. This chip is great for heavily multi-threaded workloads and productivity software, and it works just fine for gaming too.Well, what about GPU performance then? That's where the bottleneck generally is for gaming, but the pair of XFX Double Dissipation R9 280s running in crossfire can crush any game on the market with settings maxed out at 1080p. I know a lot of people claim that in their ads, but a quick google of some benchmarks will tell you the truth. This GPU duo will give you performance comparable to a GTX 980 in most scenarios! That's just at stock settings, too. The coolers on these cards are awesome and the temps stay very low despite the crossfire configuration, which means you can overclock these bad boys for even more performance.16GB of Corsair XMS3 DDR3 1600 RAM means not having to worry about running out of memory, most games are more than fine on 8GB. This leaves you plenty of leeway to be lazy about not closing your browser tabs, and will definitely help out if you're into the productivity / editing side of things.For permanent storage, the Sandisk SSD Plus 240GB SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE license). If you've never had a PC with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back. Beyond that, I've installed a Western Digital Blue 1TB 7200RPM mechanical hard drive for all your music and cat videos and whatever else you can think of. There's also plenty of room to add more drives later if you want, the case even comes with an additional drive cage that I've detached for the time being to improve airflow.It doesn't have an optical drive built in since I've found most people don't need or want them these days, but I can throw in a brand new external USB DVD drive for $10 extra if desired. As an added note, I can also throw in a brand new basic keyboard and optical mouse for $10, but as peripherals are a highly subjective affair and also a hugely important part of your gaming experience, I strongly recommend buying some nicer ones that suit your personal preferences.The XFX TS series of power supplies is actually built by Seasonic, the best PSU makers in the business. They are solid, high quality units, and I've probably used more XFX TS / Core branded supplies in my builds than any other line.Finally, we have the Ultra Rogue M925 full tower chassis that everything has been built into. Ultra isn't a very well-known brand, but I used a Rogue M925 for a build I did last year and I was very impressed with it. Despite coming from a no-name brand, it compares quite favorably to many of the other high-end cases I've worked with and has all the features you'd expect from a flagship chassis, including dust filters that are easier to access than just about any other case I've ever worked with, super easy cable routing, built-in fan controllers, plus an SD/MMC/MS card reader, toolless drive bays, removable drive cages, and tons of ventilation / fan mounts. Notably, I was able to mount a massive Cooler Master Megaflow 200mm blue LED intake fan on the side panel to help keep the GPUs nice and cool. Anyway, I really like this chassis. Just as before, it was a piece of cake to work in, and I think it looks great too.So there you have it. This rig provides a boatload of performance on a budget, and has even more untapped potential that can be unleashed with overclocking. Half of the components are brand new, and it would cost you over $1100 to buy the same (or roughly equivalent performance) parts according to the lowest prices available on pcpartpicker.com right now, so I am selling it for a good deal LESS than it would cost you to go out and purchase these same components yourself, and I'm basically giving away my labor for free. Help me give this beastly machine a good home!Price is firm, I know that this machine is worth a lot more than I'm asking, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers though.

39206237,100% BRAND NEW Skylake i7 6700K + R9 390X Killer PC, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell high quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.Every single component in this system is BRAND NEW, and I put the rig together specifically with the intention to sell, so it's in absolutely pristine condition - it has only been 'used' for the OS and driver / software installation and subsequent benchmarking and stability testing. And best of all, I'm selling it for less than it would cost you to buy the exact same parts yourself, and I've already done all the work of putting it together. The last several times I've posted machines of this caliber they've sold in less than a day.This machine is a complete powerhouse loaded with all the latest tech, including an Intel Skylake i7 6700k processor, 16GB of DDR4 memory, and an MSI R9 390X 8GB video card. It's able to crush any game on the market with maxed out settings without breaking a sweat, and it can easily handle your video / photo editing and productivity needs too.Here are the full specs:Intel Skylake i7 6700k CPUCooler Master V8 GTS CoolerMSI Z170A Pro MotherboardMSI R9 390X Gaming 8G Graphics CardGskill Ripjaws V 16GB (2x8GB) DDR4 2400 RAMSamsung 850 Evo 250GB SSDWestern Digital Blue 4TB Secondary HDDEVGA Supernova NEX 750W Gold Rated Modular Power SupplyPhanteks Enthoo Pro M Chassis w/2x Corsair AF140 Red LED Fans+ Genuine Windows 10 Professional 64 BitThe i7 6700K is the top model from Intel's latest Skylake line of CPUs, sporting 4 physical cores and 4 virtual cores from hyperthreading that clock up to 4.2GHz at stock settings. These chips have been in crazy high demand ever since their release, just getting your hands on one has been near impossible for the last several months. If you're looking for the hottest new thing in the world of processors, this is it. I've got a Cooler Master V8 GTS cooler installed with this chip, which does a great job of keeping it cool and will allow you to overclock it for even more performance if desired. It also looks amazing!One of the other nice things about the Skylake processors is they come with a new platform that supports all the latest technology, and the MSI Z170A Pro is no exception. It has USB3.1, supports DDR4 memory, M.2 NVMe SSDs, SATA Express, and naturally it also has the usual stuff like 7.1 Channel Audio and a bunch of options for overclocking your processor. Not only that, but this motherboard should also be able to support whatever the next generation of Intel processors is going to be with a simple firmware update when the time comes.For graphics, the MSI R9 390X Gaming 8GB in this rig is a monster card that trades blows with Nvidia's GTX 980 for performance and sports double the VRAM. The 390X tends to fare slightly better at higher resolutions and also looks to be better positioned to handle upcoming DX12 titles thanks to AMD's inclusion of asynchronous compute hardware, whereas a 980 tends to take the lead in current DX11 titles - but not by a big margin. This card gets 60fps on the brutal DX11 Heaven benchmark that I use for graphics stress testing (with everything cranked up to max), and the 980s I've benched tend to land around 64fps.Aside from those generalizations, it's really going to come down to the individual game you're playing and whether it's more friendly to AMD or Nvidia drivers, but on top of that any titles that support the Mantle API will get a big performance boost.16GB of Gskill Ripjaws V DDR4 2400MHz RAM means not having to worry about running out of memory, most games are more than fine on just 8GB. This leaves you plenty of leeway to be lazy about not closing your browser tabs and running other programs in the background while you play. There are also two slots still available on the motherboard if you want to add more memory at some point in the (likely distant) future, and the board can support up to a whopping 64GB in total.For permanent storage, the wicked fast Samsung 850 Evo 250GB SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE license). If you've never had a machine with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back. Then for secondary storage, there's the Western Digital Blue 4TB HDD to provide tons of extra space for all your music and cat videos and whatever else you can think of. There's also room to add more drives later if you want to, and as mentioned the motherboard includes support for both M.2 and Sata Express drives in addition to standard SATA3.There's no DVD / optical drive installed since I've found most people don't use them any more, BUT if you want one I can include a brand new external USB DVD drive that will get the job done for an extra $10 or so. As an added note, I can also throw in a brand new basic keyboard and optical mouse for $10, but as peripherals are a highly subjective affair and also a hugely important part of your gaming experience, I strongly recommend buying some nicer ones that suit your personal preferences.The EVGA Supernova NEX 750W power supply provides more juice than you'll ever need for this rig - the 390X is a power hungry card, so I intentionally overbuilt with extra output on tap. I'm kinda picky about power supplies, and I try to stick to Corsair, EVGA, or Seasonic built units for the most part. This particular model is fully modular, which means you only plug in the cables you actually need and cuts down on clutter inside the case, and it has an 80 Plus Gold efficiency rating for lower power bills.Last of all we have the Phanteks Enthoo Pro M chassis that everything is built into. This was my first time building inside a Phaneks case, and I have to say I'm impressed. It's a very elegant, uncluttered, and no-nonsense design. It's also a dream to build in, and you can tell the guys at Phanteks really put a lot of thought into it from all the small details. It's hard to convey in just a few words, but some cases are just flat out easier to work with than others, and I was constantly impressed by this one. I'm pretty OCD about making my builds as clean as possible, and I was very happy with how this one turned out, I think the interior of this machine might be one of the best looking I've ever done. I went ahead and added a pair of Corsair AF140 red fans to the front for improved airflow too.So there you have it. This rig is an absolute powerhouse loaded with all the latest goodies, and it looks fantastic while delivering killer performance. It would run you almost $1600 just to buy all these same parts right now, and then you'd still have to put it all together yourself. So I'm selling it for LESS than it would cost you to go out and build it yourself and essentially giving away my professional-grade labor for free. Help me give this gorgeous beast a good home!Price is firm, I know this rig is worth more than I'm asking for it, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers though. You have to see this machine in person to fully appreciate it."
39206233,4.5GHz Hex-Core i7 + Dual 290X Lightning Crossfire Super Beast, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell high quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.This is one of the most powerful gaming machines I've ever built, and it is an absolute monster loaded with top-shelf gear, including an overclocked Intel i7 3930K hex-core CPU and a pair of MSI R9 290X Lightning graphics cards, plus more than a terabyte of solid state storage. Let's be clear: This rig is not for someone who wants to dink around with casual gaming at 1080p. This beast is for someone who wants to play cutting edge titles at high resolution and also wants to be able to handle video editing and productivity software with ease.Here are the full specs:Intel Sandy Bridge E 3930K ES CPU @ 4.5GHzLepa Aquachanger 240 Liquid Cooler (Brand New)ASUS ROG Rampage IV Black MotherboardTwo MSI R9 290X Lightning 4GB Graphics Cards in CrossfireCorsair Dominator 16GB (4x4GB) DDR3 2133MHz CAS9 1.5V RAMSamsung 850 Pro 256GB SSDSamsung 840 Evo 1TB SSDWestern Digital Black 4TB Secondary HDDEnermax MaxRevo 1500W Gold Rated PSUSilverstone red 24-pin cable extension (Brand New)Rosewill Thor V2 Chassis (Brand New)Cooler Master Storm Devastator Red LED Backlit KB/Mouse Combo (Brand New)Windows 10 Professional 64 BitIntel's i7 3930k CPU is a hex-core / 12-thread powerhouse hailing from the 'Extreme' line that falls outside the normal consumer stack. This chip can crank out an absolute ton of processing power, which is great if you're into CAD or video editing, or even if you just like having the biggest baddest rig on the block and want to future-proof for DX12 games that will be able to tap that extra horsepower. I've also got it overclocked to 4.5GHz currently, which is frankly overkill for almost any workload you are likely to throw at it, and the Lepa Aquachanger 240 liquid cooling system does a great job of keeping temps down despite the increased clock speed and voltage.What about the Skylake CPUs that Intel just released, you might ask? Well, the simple truth is that Intel has only been making marginal performance improvements from one generation to the next since AMD has effectively dropped out of competition in the high performance CPU market. Check out the following page of benchmarks and notice that the i7 2600k at stock speeds yields nearly the same FPS in almost every instance to the brand new Skylake i7 6700k:http://anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/22Now with that in mind, remember that THIS chip is essentially a 2600k with 50% more processing power thanks to the extra 2 cores, and that it has further been overclocked up to 4.5GHz. So, not only does it have NO trouble keeping up in gaming performance, it beats the 6700k in any software that can take advantage of the extra 2 cores and 4 threads. You could turn off the overclock and run it at stock settings for lower temps and it would still be an unstoppable beast firmly wedged in the top tier of CPUs:http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/cpu-hierarchy,4312.htmlAs for the motherboard, the ASUS flagship Republic of Gamers Rampage IV Black is widely considered to be the best X79 motherboard on the market, and it is overflowing with bells and whistles. It has pretty much everything you could ever ask for in terms of overclocking, tons of USB3 ports, SupremeFX audio, integrated wifi and bluetooth, and quad SLI / Crossfire support.The pair of crossfired MSI R9 290X Lightning graphics cards are also widely considered to be the best version of the GPU on the market (notice a pattern?) and they form the beating heart of this monster's crazy gaming performance. The 290X is the same GPU as the 'new' 390X cards, just rebranded. The Lightning cards in particular are designed with overclocking in mind with extra beefy 3-slot coolers and an extra power connector each for cranking up the voltages, plus metal backplates for improved rigidity. I haven't bothered to overclock them however, since even at stock settings they push out a bonkers amount of FPS. I ran the highly intensive Heaven DX11 benchmark with all settings maxed out at 1080p and got a whopping 120FPS, nearly double the performance of a single GTX 980. Needless to say, these cards are wasted at 1080p and really would be much better suited to 1440p or 4k screens. An Oculus Rift would also be a good candidate for taking advantage of the insane performance of these cards.The super premium 16GB Corsair Dominator GT memory is very special in that it DOESN'T jack up the CAS Latency or voltage in order to achieve its 2133MHz rating. It's rated for CAS9 and 1.5v, which means it outperforms most DDR4 RAM on the market and still has room to overclock even further if you want to give it a voltage bump - not that you would need to. This RAM is quite rare and hard to find, and understandably so, but if you want to double up to 32GB (really only for futureproofing, 16GB is plenty right now) I know a guy that is looking to sell an identical kit that could be installed in the 4 open slots (the motherboard has 8 total memory slots, and can theoretically support up to 128GB of RAM).For permanent storage, the 256GB Samsung 850 Pro SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE and legal license). If you've never had a PC with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back. The 850 Pro is also the best SATA3 drive on the market, and can only be bested by an M2 or PCI-E model such as the brand new Samsung 950 Pro. You could drop in a PCI-E drive later if you want, but the 850 Pro is already blazing fast and is not likely to leave you wanting.Want more solid state storage to act as a scratch drive for video editing, or to store your entire library of games without long load times? Never fear, there's also a wicked fast 1TB Samsung 840 Evo SSD installed. What about your massive collection of bluray quality cat videos and roughly 60000 hours of elevator music? There's ALSO a best-in-class Western Digital Black HDD with a whopping 4TB of secondary storage, and if you (somehow) manage to fill all that up there are still plenty of drive bays and SATA ports to spare, so you can very easily add more drives later.There's no DVD / optical drive installed since I've found most people don't use them any more, BUT if you want one I can include a brand new external USB DVD drive that will get the job done for an extra $10 or so.Enermax's 1500W Gold Rated MaxRevo modular power supply provides more than enough juice for even this fully decked out rig and gets a superb 9.6 rating from JonnyGuru, THE goto power supply review site. The biggest detractor in its final scoring is the MSRP of $359.99, which you don't have to pay! This is a really fantastic unit:http://www.jonnyguru.com/modules.php?name=NDReviews&op=Story6&reid=302Finally we have the Rosewill Thor V2 chassis that all this top notch kit has been built in. Rosewill is Newegg's house brand, and the quality of their parts can vary pretty drastically from one model to the next. Fortunately, the Thor V2 sits at the top of that spectrum and boasts phenomenal cooling performance (an absolute must for a build loaded up with high-performance parts like this one). It's very highly regarded, has won a ton of awards, and in my own personal experience it was a breeze to build in. Of course it has all the features of a flagship case, removable dust filters and easy access removable drive bays, tons of cable management space and routing, integrated fan controllers, etc, and it's loaded up with three monster 200mm fans and a 140mm exhaust. I couldn't be happier with its functionality, and it looks great too!I will also be throwing in a Cooler Master Storm Devastator gaming keyboard and mouse combo with matching red LEDs for free just to get you started, but I highly recommend you pick up peripherals that suit your personal preferences at some point in the future, since that will have a big impact on your experience using the system.So there you have it. This machine is a monster that can handle any kind of workload you throw at it, and it's an absolute beast when it comes to gaming that shouldn't need any kind of upgrade for years to come (but there's plenty of room for expansion just in case).Please help me give this machine a good home! This thing is a steal considering all the top tier components, it would cost you more than $3500 to buy all the same parts right now according to the lowest prices available on PCPartPicker - and then you'd still have to put it together yourself. So I'm offering a huge discount on the hardware, and basically giving my professional level labor away for free.Please don't insult me with lowball offers, I know that this machine is worth a lot more than I'm asking, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers. You have to see this machine in person, you will want to adopt it into your family."
39206222,i7 + Dual GPU Beast on a Budget, Desktops,"(Will accept CASH ONLY, leave me alone scammers!)I'm an A+ certified computer technician with over 15 years experience building gaming machines, and I sell high quality custom built PCs for LESS than their market value by hunting down the best deals on individual parts and essentially giving my labor away for free. I take pride in my work, and I've put together dozens of rigs for very happy customers over the last year.If you want high end performance without the high end price, this machine is for you. It's loaded with an i7 2600k 8-thread processor that can easily handle video editing and productivity software, as well as two R9 270X video cards in Crossfire that can crush any game on the market. These are excellent parts from only a few generations back, so they are still very relevant and a great way to get high performance on a budget. Additionally, many of the components were purchased brand new just for this build.Here are the full specs:Intel Sandy Bridge i7 2600K CPUCorsair Hydro H70 Liquid CoolerAsrock Z68 Extreme3 MotherboardTwo Gigabyte R9 270X Windforce GPUs in CrossfireCrucial Ballistix Sport 16GB (2x8GB) DDR3 1600Sandisk SSD Plus 240GB (Brand New)Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD (Brand New)EVGA Supernova B2 750W Modular PSU (Brand New)Corsair Carbide 500R White Chassis (Brand New)Arctic F12 PWM 120MM Fan (Brand New)+ Genuine Windows 10 Professional 64 BitIntel's i7 2600K is a powerhouse CPU that clocks in at 3.8GHz with Turbo enabled and can handle 8 threads simultaneously with hyperthreading. With the near total lack of competition from AMD in the high end desktop market, Intel has only been making small incremental improvements in their CPUs from one generation to the next, to the point where you'd be hard pressed to notice any major difference between a Sandy Bridge chip and the latest Skylake models in real world applications, and particularly in gaming. Check out the following page of benchmarks and note that the i7 2600K only trails a few FPS behind the new Skylake i7 6700k in almost every instance:http://anandtech.com/show/9483/intel-skylake-review-6700k-6600k-ddr4-ddr3-ipc-6th-generation/22Now, keep in mind those benchmarks are with the CPU running at stock speeds, and the K at the end of the SKU means this chip is unlocked and ready to be overclocked in order to unleash even more performance. To that end, I've fitted it with the excellent Corsair H70 liquid cooler, which keeps it in the frosty 50c range even under extreme torture test loads and leaves you a ton of thermal headroom for cranking up the clock speeds. The upshot is this CPU is still a fantastic performer and won't need to be upgraded or replaced for years to come, and it additionally has extra untapped performance that can be had for free via overclocking.Similarly, the pair of crossfired Gigabyte R9 270X graphics cards have the fantastic Windforce cooling solutions that keep them in the 50c range under load, and thus they also have lots of headroom for overclocking. As it is, even at stock settings these two GPUs working in concert provide a ton of graphical horsepower, and while Crossfire scaling isn't universal, on average these cards should give you performance comparable to or better than an R9 390. There isn't a game out there that these cards can't handle on max settings at 1080p, and the aforementioned overclocking potential means you can very easily unlock extra performance in the future should you need it.16GB of Crucial Ballistix Sport DDR3 RAM means not having to worry about running out of memory, most games are more than fine on 8GB. This leaves you plenty of leeway to be lazy about not closing your browser tabs, and there are still 2 slots open if you want to pop in another kit later.For permanent storage, the brand new Sandisk SSD Plus 240GB SSD serves as the primary drive and has a fresh copy of Windows 10 Professional 64-bit installed, activated, and fully updated (using a GENUINE license). If you've never had a PC with an SSD before, it will blow your mind with how much faster and generally more responsive it makes the whole system - you'll never want to go back. Beyond that, I've installed a brand new Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200RPM mechanical hard drive for all your music and cat videos and whatever else you can think of. There's also plenty of room to add more drives later if you want, the case even comes with an additional drive cage that I've detached for the time being to improve airflow.It doesn't have an optical drive built in since I've found most people don't need or want them these days, but I can throw in a brand new external USB DVD drive for $10 extra if desired. As an added note, I can also throw in a brand new basic keyboard and optical mouse for $10, but as peripherals are a highly subjective affair and also a hugely important part of your gaming experience, I strongly recommend buying some nicer ones that suit your personal preferences.The EVGA Supernova 750W B2 power supply is also brand new, and is a solid high-quality unit that provides plenty of juice for this beast. I've used this model of supply many times in the past, and it's always been a great performer.Finally, we have the brand new Corsair Carbide 500R chassis that everything is built in. Corsair consistently produces some of my all-time favorite cases, and the 500R is no exception. Of course it has all the features you'd expect from a high end chassis: easy access removable dust filters, built-in fan controller, excellent cable management, removable drive trays and cage, the works. It also boasts some truly phenomenal airflow, enabling the CPU and GPU coolers to perform at their best. All that and it looks absolutely fantastic too! It's hard to capture with my derpy phone camera, but the fan LEDs are white, not blue, and there's a switch on the front of the case to easily turn the LEDs off if you prefer a more subdued look.So there you have it. This rig provides a boatload of performance on a budget, and has even more untapped potential that can be unleashed with overclocking. It would cost you around $1300 to buy the same (or roughly equivalent performance) parts according to the lowest prices available on pcpartpicker.com right now, so I am selling it for a good deal LESS than it would cost you to go out and purchase these same components yourself, and I'm basically giving away my labor for free. Help me give this beastly machine a good home!Lowball offers will be summarily dismissed, and I'm afraid I can't do any trades - I need the cash to pay bills. :(I'll be happy to deliver (within reason) and set it up or demo it for any serious buyers though. You have to see this machine in person to fully appreciate it."

The SERVER-IO can be configured with up to three total audio networking cards per server. The combinations of networking cards can include up to one AVB-1 Audio Video Bridging network card, up to two SCM-1 CobraNet network cards, and up to two DAN-1 Dante network cards in any configuration. An integral network card provides network connectivity for configuration and control of the Tesira network.The on-board DSP features two new Biamp algorithms, SpeechSense&#65533; and AmbientSense&#65533;, which enhance speech processing by more accurately distinguishing between human speech and noise. The DSP also provides extensive audio processing, including but not limited to: signal routing and mixing, equalization, filtering, dynamics, and delay as well as control, monitoring and diagnostic tools; all configured through the Tesira design software.Customizable I/O configurations enable easy right-sizing of system design, and I/O can be distributed from a central location.

This is a new sealed in its retail box Color Laser Samsung CLP-315W Wireless and USB Printer.  I bought two of these nice printers because we thought we would be printing in two locations. But we are only using one. We love it. The second one is sealed in its box.  It is much more expensive than this to buy it retail, so $99 is a great deal.  Since we have been using this printer's sister, we have not had to worry about messy ink or smears on the page or bad looking prints.  Lasers are so good you can easily print resumes on them.We have used it a lot, and it barely affects the level of laser toner powder.  Its going to be years before we have to replace the huge dry powder cartridges.  Yet the printer is only 9 inches tall by 13 deep and 14 wide.  And, we can go on vacation or not use the printer for a long time and not worry about drying out the ink cartridges like you do on a wet ink printer.  We have ruined several printers because of the cartridges drying out.The Samsung software is extremely simple and does not clutter up our computer like all the HP's we have had in the past. And we NEVER have problems with it. Not even paper jams.I would keep it as a spare to use years down the road, but the box has a lot of foam and takes up space I have to use now.

Really useful if you want to hardwire things rather than clog up your wifi. You need a pair of them to work. You will see the lights flash as they pair across your electrical wiring and then they are done. No settings to mess with just plug them in and go. I have used them quite a bit but just don't need them anymore with my current home.They do have some limitations. They won't work plugged into a powerstrip and pretty much need to be plugged directly into the wall. Also it helps if they are plugged into the same general area of the house. I tested them quite a bit with different outlets throughout my house and there were a few that were just too far away to work. Probably because of the fuse box or something like that. However I've had them going from the main level livingroom to the basement without any issues.If you're interested let me know. text is best, but you can email or call as well.

38844104,Apple MC914LL 27-inch Thunderbolt Display, Monitors,"This computer monitor was used for work in an office setting and is in like-new condition.Description:The Apple Thunderbolt Display (27-Inch) is intended to be the ""ultimate docking station"" for a Thunderbolt-equipped Mac notebook (it is not compatible with earlier Macs). Thunderbolt makes it possible to connect one cable and use this display's built-in FaceTime HD camera, mic, 2.1 speakers (49 watts), three USB 2.0 ports, single Firewire ""800"" port, single Gigabit Ethernet port, and Thunderbolt port. In addition to the built-in Thunderbolt cable, the display also has a built-in MagSafe connector that charges a Thunderbolt-equipped MacBook Air or MacBook Pro.With the exception of connectivity, this display is similar to the LED Cinema Display (27-Inch) that preceded it, and likewise uses the same sleek aluminum case and features a 27-inch glossy LED-backlit TFT active-matrix LCD display with IPS technology and an optimum resolution of 2560x1440. It has a 178 degree horizontal and vertical viewing angle, a ""typical"" brightness of 375 cd/m2, contrast ratio of 1000:1, and a 12 ms response time.Key FeaturesRevolutionary Thunderbolt TechnologyDeveloped by Intel with collaboration from Apple, high-speed Thunderbolt I/O (input/output) technology delivers an amazing 10 gigabits per second of transfer speeds in both directions. The Thunderbolt port allows you to connect to new Thunderbolt-compatible peripherals as well as existing USB and FireWire peripherals using simple adapters. You'll be able to move data up to 20 times faster than with USB 2.0 and more than 12 times faster than with FireWire 800, and you can daisy-chain up to six high-speed devices without using a hub. Thunderbolt also supports DisplayPort for high resolution displays and works with existing adapters for HDMI, DVI, and VGA displays.Single-Cable ConvenienceWith its 27-inch LED-backlit screen, the new Thunderbolt Display delivers a brilliant viewing experience. But connect it to any Thunderbolt-enabled Mac, and it becomes a plug-and-play hub for everything you do. With just one cable, you'll get high-resolution screen space, high-quality audio, a FaceTime HD camera, FireWire 800, and Gigabit Ethernet ports--and a Thunderbolt port you can use to daisy-chain additional high-performance peripherals such as hard drives and video capture devices.Plug In and Power UpThe Thunderbolt Display includes a MagSafe connector that powers and charges your MacBook Pro or MacBook Air. The connector sits on your desk, ready and waiting. No need to unwind the cord to the power adapter that came with your notebook.Integrated FaceTime WebcamYou'll be able to easily connect with friends, family, and business colleagues using the MacBook Air's FaceTime camera, which is integrated into the thin bezel above the display. And with Apple's FaceTime application, you're not limited to video chats with other Macs--you can now make video calls to iPhone and iPod touch users (Wi-Fi connection required for mobile users).SpecificationsDisplay2560 x 1440-pixel resolution16.7 million colors16:9 aspect ratio178� horizontal/vertical viewing angle375 cd/m2 brightness1000:1 contrast ratio12 ms response timeAudio and VideoFaceTime HD camera with microphone2.1 speaker system (49 watts)WarrantyThree powered USB 2.0 portsFireWire 800 portGigabit Ethernet portThunderbolt portKensington security slotCablesBuilt-in Thunderbolt cableBuilt-in Universal MagSafe cable (up to 85W)Size and Weight25.7 x 8.15 x 19.35 inches (WxDxH)23.5 poundsSystem RequirementsThunderbolt-enabled Mac computer, including MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and iMacOS X v10.6.8 or later"
